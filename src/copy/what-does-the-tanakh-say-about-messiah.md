_"For dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has closed in on me; they pierced my hands and my feet. I can count all my bones; people look and stare at me. They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing."_
**(Psalm 22:16-18)**

## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is the Messiah!

Beloved, as Jewish people, you carry the sacred hope of the Messiah, the Anointed One promised in the Tanakh. With love and certainty, I proclaim: **Yeshua of Nazareth is that Messiah**! He fulfills every role foretold—King, Prophet, Priest, Suffering Servant, and Redeemer—and will return to establish G-d’s eternal kingdom. Let us explore the Tanakh’s rich portrait of the Messiah, trusting the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His truth.

## The Tanakh’s Portrait: The Messiah’s Divine Roles

The Hebrew Scriptures unveil the Messiah, the _Mashiach_ (Anointed One), in vivid detail through distinct yet unified roles:

- **Davidic King Forever**: In **2 Samuel 7:12-16**, G-d promises David, “I will raise up your offspring after you… I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” This eternal King is reiterated in **Jeremiah 23:5-6**: “Behold, the days are coming… when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and He shall reign as king and deal wisely, and execute justice and righteousness… His name will be called: The L-RD Our Righteousness.” The Messiah is a just, divine ruler from David’s line.
- **G-d’s Anointed Son**: **Psalm 2:7-8** declares, “You are My Son; today I have begotten You. Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations for Your inheritance.” This Messianic King, G-d’s Son, rules Zion and the world with divine authority.
- **Prophet Like Moses**: **Deuteronomy 18:15-19** promises, “The L-RD your G-d will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you… I will put My words in his mouth.” The Messiah speaks G-d’s truth with unmatched authority, leading His people as Moses did.
- **Priest of Melchizedek**: **Psalm 110:4** states, “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” The Messiah mediates between G-d and humanity, offering atonement.
- **Suffering Servant**: **Isaiah 52:13–53:12** portrays a Servant who suffers: “He was pierced for our transgressions… by His wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). **Psalm 22:16** adds, “They pierced my hands and my feet,” fulfilled in Yeshua’s crucifixion.
- **Redeemer and Shepherd**: **Micah 5:2** foretells, “From you, Bethlehem Ephrathah… shall come forth… one who is to be ruler in Israel.” **Ezekiel 34:23-24** promises a Davidic shepherd to unite and lead Israel.
- **Bringer of Peace**: **Isaiah 2:2-4** envisions nations streaming to Jerusalem, where “nation shall not lift up sword against nation.” **Isaiah 11:6-9** adds, “The earth will be full of the knowledge of the L-RD.”

## Yeshua: The Fulfillment of Every Role

Yeshua perfectly fulfills these prophecies in two divine phases:

- **First Coming: Servant, Prophet, Priest**  
  Born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), from David’s line, Yeshua taught with divine authority as the Prophet like Moses (John 7:16). He offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling **Isaiah 53:5** and **Psalm 22:16**: “They pierced my hands and my feet.” As the eternal Priest (Psalm 110:4), His death atoned for sin, and His resurrection confirmed His victory.
- **Second Coming: King and Peace-Bringer**  
  Yeshua inaugurated G-d’s kingdom spiritually (Luke 17:21) and ascended to G-d’s right hand (**Psalm 2:7**; **Psalm 110:1**). At His return, He will rule as the righteous Branch (**Jeremiah 23:5-6**), bringing peace and restoring Israel (Isaiah 11; Ezekiel 37).

## Addressing Objections with Truth

We honor your questions and answer with Scripture and love:

- **“Why no peace yet?”** The Tanakh shows a suffering Messiah (**Isaiah 53**) and a reigning King (**Isaiah 2**). Yeshua fulfilled the first; His return will fulfill the second.
- **“Is the Servant Israel or Messiah?”** While some see Israel in **Isaiah 53**, its individual language (e.g., “pierced for our transgressions”) and ancient Jewish texts (e.g., Talmud Sukkah 52a) point to a personal Messiah, fulfilled by Yeshua.
- **“Why didn’t all Jews believe?”** **Isaiah 53:1** predicted rejection: “Who has believed our report?” Yet thousands of Jews followed Yeshua (Acts 2:41), and **Romans 11:26** promises “all Israel will be saved.”

## The Call: Trust Yeshua, the Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua is the Messiah—King (**2 Samuel 7:12-16**), Prophet (**Deuteronomy 18:15-19**), Priest (**Psalm 110:4**), and Suffering Servant (**Isaiah 53**; **Psalm 22:16**). No one else fulfills these roles. He died for your sins, rose, and reigns, offering eternal life. We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is L-RD and believe in your heart that G-d raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **2 Samuel 7**, **Jeremiah 23**, **Psalm 2**, **Deuteronomy 18**, **Isaiah 53**, **Psalm 22**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask G-d to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes G-d’s covenant.

## Final Word: The Messiah Fulfills All!

Yeshua, the pierced Servant and coming King, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, He calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
