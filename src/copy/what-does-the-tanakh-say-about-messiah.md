# What Does the Tanakh Say About the Messiah?

**A deep dive into Scripture and Truth**

Shalom, dear brothers and sisters,

For thousands of years, we have waited and prayed for the coming of the Messiah. The promises of God recorded in the Tanakh (the Hebrew Scriptures) fill our hearts with hope and longing for that glorious day. But what exactly does the Tanakh say about the Messiah? Let us gently explore these rich promises together.

### The Anointed King from David’s Line

The Hebrew word *Mashiach* means "Anointed One." In ancient Israel, kings, priests, and prophets were anointed with oil to signify their appointment by God. The Messiah, above all, is described as a coming King from the royal line of David.

In **2 Samuel 7:12-16**, God promised David that one of his descendants would sit on the throne forever. **Jeremiah 23:5-6** echoes this, saying: "Behold, the days are coming... when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He shall reign as king and deal wisely, and execute justice and righteousness in the land." This King will not only rule Israel but bring peace and justice to the entire world.

**Psalm 2** beautifully describes this anointed King as God's own Son, whom He installs on Zion, declaring, "You are My Son; today I have begotten you." The Messiah will inherit all nations and bring God's rule to the ends of the earth.

### A Prophet Like Moses

The Tanakh also tells us that God would send a prophet like Moses. In **Deuteronomy 18:15-19**, God says: "I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; and I will put My words in his mouth." Like Moses, this prophet would reveal God's will, lead His people, and speak with divine authority.

### A Priest Forever

In **Psalm 110**, we read a remarkable promise: "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek." The Messiah will not only be King but also Priest, standing as a mediator between God and His people. This priestly role points to a Messiah who brings atonement and lasting peace.

### The Suffering Servant

One of the most profound and mysterious pictures of the Messiah appears in **Isaiah 52:13–53:12**. Here, the "Servant of the LORD" is described as one who suffers, is despised and rejected, bears the sins of others, and ultimately brings healing and forgiveness: "By His wounds we are healed."

While many Jewish interpretations see the Servant as Israel itself, others recognize that these words could also describe a righteous individual who suffers on behalf of others. The picture of atonement, suffering, and victory through affliction is deeply moving and opens the door to profound reflection on the Messiah's role.

### A Redeemer and Shepherd

The Messiah is also described as a redeemer who will gather the scattered exiles of Israel. **Ezekiel 34 and 37** speak of God appointing "My servant David" to shepherd His people, unite the nation, and lead them in peace. **Micah 5:2** even foretells the Messiah's birth in Bethlehem: "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah... from you shall come forth for Me one who is to be ruler in Israel."

In **Zechariah 9:9**, we are invited to rejoice: "Behold, your King is coming to you; righteous and having salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey." This image paints a picture of a gentle, yet victorious Messiah bringing peace and righteousness.

### The Messianic Age of Peace

The Tanakh envisions a glorious future when the Messiah reigns. **Isaiah 2:2-4** promises that all nations will stream to Jerusalem to learn God's ways: "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore." **Isaiah 11** describes a world filled with peace, where even animals live in harmony and "the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea."

### A Loving Invitation

Dear friend, could it be that these diverse portraits—King, Prophet, Priest, Suffering Servant, Redeemer—are not contradictory, but complementary? Could they all describe one Messiah who fulfills each role in perfect harmony?

Many of us believe that Yeshua is this promised Messiah. In His first coming, He fulfilled the role of the Suffering Servant, bringing atonement and healing. He was born in Bethlehem, taught God's Word as the Prophet like Moses, and offered Himself as the ultimate Priest and Redeemer. His resurrection gives hope that He is the King who will return to establish the full peace and glory of the Messianic Age.

I share this not to argue, but to invite you to explore these Scriptures anew. May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob open all our hearts to see the fullness of His promises.

With love and deep respect,

A fellow seeker of Israel's Messiah.
