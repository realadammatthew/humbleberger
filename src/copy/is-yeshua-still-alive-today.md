## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is Alive!

Beloved, the truth that Yeshua of Nazareth lives today is the heartbeat of G-d’s redemptive plan for Israel and the world. As Jewish people, you cherish the Tanakh’s promise of a Messiah, and with joy we proclaim: **Yeshua, risen and reigning, is that Messiah**! His resurrection and ongoing life fulfill prophecy, conquer death, and offer salvation to all who trust Him. Let us explore this truth, trusting the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His Messiah.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Messiah Who Lives Forever

The Hebrew Scriptures foretell a Messiah who triumphs over death:

- **Psalm 16:10**: “You will not let Your Holy One see decay.” David spoke prophetically of Messiah, whose body would not rot.
- **Isaiah 53:10-11**: The Suffering Servant, “cut off” for our sins, will “prolong His days,” pointing to resurrection.
- **Daniel 7:13-14**: The “Son of Man” receives eternal dominion, fulfilled in Yeshua’s ascension.
- **Jonah, Joseph, Isaac**: Their stories of death and return prefigure Messiah’s resurrection.

The Tanakh lays a clear foundation for a Messiah who dies yet lives forever, fulfilled in Yeshua.

## The New Covenant Witness: The Risen Yeshua

After His crucifixion, Yeshua’s disciples were broken. Yet, on the third day, they encountered the risen Yeshua, transforming their despair into bold faith:

- Mary Magdalene saw Him in the garden (John 20:16).
- He walked with disciples to Emmaus (Luke 24:15).
- He ate with the apostles (Luke 24:41-43).
- Over 500 saw Him at once (1 Corinthians 15:6).
- Skeptics like James, His brother, and Paul, a persecutor, became believers after meeting Him (Acts 9).

These physical encounters—touching, eating, speaking—spanned forty days. The disciples, once fearful, died proclaiming Him. As Paul declared, “Since Messiah has been raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over Him” (Romans 6:9).

## Why Yeshua’s Life Matters Today

Yeshua’s resurrection and ongoing life are the foundation of our hope:

1. **High Priest Forever**: “He always lives to intercede for those who come to G-d through Him” (Hebrews 7:25), securing forgiveness.
2. **Reigning L-RD**: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me” (Matthew 28:18). Yeshua rules, advancing His kingdom.
3. **Present by His Spirit**: “I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you” (John 14:18). His Spirit empowers and comforts believers.
4. **Returning King**: His resurrection guarantees His return to bring peace to Israel and the world (Isaiah 11).

## Addressing Objections with Truth

We honor your questions and answer with Scripture and love:

- **“Where’s the Messianic peace?”** Yeshua’s first coming fulfilled the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53); His second will bring the kingly reign (Isaiah 11).
- **“A divine Messiah isn’t Jewish!”** The Tanakh calls Messiah “Mighty G-d” (Isaiah 9:6) and “The L-RD Our Righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6). Daniel 7 shows Him worshipped. Yeshua’s divinity fulfills these.
- **“Where’s the evidence?”** The empty tomb, 500+ witnesses, transformed disciples, and global Messianic Synagogue growth confirm His resurrection. Even Jewish scholar Pinchas Lapide found it the best explanation.

## The Call: Trust the Living Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua lives, fulfilling Psalm 16, Isaiah 53, and Daniel 7. No one else conquered death to reign forever. He died for your sins and lives to save you. We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is L-RD and believe in your heart that G-d raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Psalm 16**, **Isaiah 53**, **Daniel 7**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask G-d to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes G-d’s covenant.

## Final Word: The Messiah Lives!

Yeshua, alive forever, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, He calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the Living One, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
