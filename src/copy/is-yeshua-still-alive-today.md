# Is Yeshua Still Alive Today?

**One of history's greatest mysteries**

For many of my Jewish friends, the claim that Yeshua (Jesus) is alive today may seem incredible. It sounds, perhaps, like a purely Christian belief, far removed from Jewish tradition. Yet, the earliest followers of Yeshua were Jews, deeply rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures, who were absolutely convinced that their Messiah had not only died but had risen and now lives forever. I invite you to walk with me as we explore this profound truth together.

### The Hebrew Scriptures Whispered It First

Long before Yeshua's birth, the Tanakh hinted that God's Messiah would conquer death:

* **Psalm 16:10** promises that God would not let His "Holy One see decay." Peter, in Acts 2, explained that since King David's body did decay, this must point to the Messiah—whose body would not remain in the grave.
* **Isaiah 53** describes the Suffering Servant who would die for our sins, yet afterward "prolong His days." How can someone die and yet live? The resurrection answers this riddle.
* **Daniel 7:13-14** shows "One like a Son of Man" coming with the clouds to receive eternal dominion. Christians see this fulfilled in Yeshua's ascension to heaven after His resurrection.
* **Jonah**, **Joseph**, and **Isaac** each prefigured a pattern of death and return to life, foreshadowing what God would do in Messiah.

The Hebrew Bible, read carefully, lays a foundation for the idea of a Messiah who would suffer, die, and yet live forever. The earliest Jewish believers in Yeshua saw these hints come to life in Him.

### The New Testament: Eyewitnesses of the Living Messiah

After Yeshua's death, His followers were devastated. But on the third day, something happened that transformed their sorrow into unshakable joy: **they encountered the risen Yeshua**. The New Testament records multiple appearances of Yeshua after His resurrection:

* He appeared to Mary Magdalene in the garden.
* He walked with two disciples on the road to Emmaus.
* He appeared to the apostles, eating and speaking with them.
* Over 500 people saw Him at once, according to 1 Corinthians 15.
* Even skeptics like His brother James and the persecutor Paul were convinced after encountering the risen Lord.

These encounters were not mystical visions or hallucinations. The disciples touched Him, ate with Him, and spoke with Him for forty days before He ascended to heaven. Their complete transformation—from fearful deserters to bold witnesses willing to die for their testimony—points to something real and life-changing. As the Apostle Paul declared, "Since Christ has been raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over Him" (Romans 6:9).

### Why the Resurrection Matters Today

The resurrection is not just an ancient event; it is the foundation of why Christians believe Yeshua is **still alive today**. But His ongoing life means even more:

**1. Yeshua is our High Priest.**
He intercedes for us in heaven, as Hebrews 7:25 says: "He always lives to intercede for those who come to God through Him." Like the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies, Yeshua stands before God for us, securing forgiveness and grace.

**2. Yeshua is Lord of all.**
Having conquered death, He reigns from God's right hand, guiding history. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me," He declared (Matthew 28:18). Though we still wait for His full reign of peace, His kingdom is advancing through changed lives across the world—including among Gentiles, fulfilling Isaiah's vision that the Messiah would be "a light to the nations."

**3. Yeshua is present with us through the Holy Spirit.**
Though physically ascended, He remains intimately present with His people. "I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you" (John 14:18). His Spirit comforts, guides, and empowers believers every day.

**4. Yeshua will return to complete the mission.**
Many Jews expect the Messiah to bring world peace and end all suffering. Christians fully agree—but believe this will be fulfilled at Yeshua's second coming. His resurrection is the guarantee that He will finish what He started.

### Addressing Honest Jewish Objections

**"But the Messiah is supposed to bring world peace. Where is it?"**
Yes, and He will. The prophets speak of both suffering and victorious aspects of the Messiah's mission. Christians understand that His first coming fulfilled the suffering servant role (Isaiah 53), and His second coming will fulfill the kingly reign (Isaiah 11).

**"Isn't the idea of a divine Messiah foreign to Judaism?"**
Surprisingly, the Tanakh hints at a Messiah greater than a mere man. Isaiah 9:6 calls Him "Mighty God." Jeremiah 23:6 names Him "The LORD Our Righteousness." Daniel 7 shows Him receiving worship alongside the Ancient of Days. These verses open the door to understanding Yeshua's divine nature.

**"Where is the evidence that He's alive?"**
The empty tomb, the multitude of eyewitnesses, the explosion of early Jewish believers, and the continued growth of the global Church all point to a risen Messiah. Even some Jewish scholars like Pinchas Lapide have acknowledged that the resurrection is the most plausible explanation for the disciples' transformation.

### A Loving Invitation

Dear friend, I understand that accepting Yeshua as Messiah is not easy. It touches deep questions of identity, tradition, and history. But I invite you to consider: **What if the Messiah really has come, died for our sins, risen from the grave, and now lives forever?**

If Yeshua lives, then death is not the end. Sin can be forgiven. We can know God personally. And one day, as promised, Messiah will return to bring peace not only to Israel but to the whole world.

Many Jewish people have prayed simply, "God of Abraham, if Yeshua is truly the Messiah, show me." And many have found that He answers.

As the resurrected Yeshua said, "Do not be afraid. I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive forever and ever!" (Revelation 1:18).

**HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
