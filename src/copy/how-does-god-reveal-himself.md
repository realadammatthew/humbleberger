## Can We Really Know G-d?

People throughout history have asked:
**Is there a G-d? And if so, how do we know who He is?**

The Bible’s answer is this: **Yes, G-d exists—and He has made Himself known**. He is not distant or hidden. In fact, the story of the Bible is the story of a G-d who **reveals** Himself, not just to a few, but to the whole world. And the fullest revelation of G-d is found in **Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah**.

## Two Ways G-d Reveals Himself

The Bible shows us that G-d reveals Himself in two main ways:

### 1. **General Revelation**

This is how G-d shows Himself through the **natural world** and in **every human heart**.

### 2. **Special Revelation**

This is how G-d speaks more directly—through **Scripture**, the **prophets**, and most clearly, through **Yeshua**.

Let’s look at both of these.

## G-d Revealed in Creation (General Revelation)

### Genesis 1

From the very beginning, G-d reveals His power by **speaking the universe into existence**. Every star, ocean, animal, and person was made by Him—and for Him.

### Psalm 19

> “The heavens declare the glory of G-d; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.”
> Creation isn’t silent—it **shouts** about G-d’s greatness, beauty, and order.

### Romans 1–2

The Apostle Paul says that **G-d’s eternal power and divine nature** are clearly seen through what has been made. Even people who have never read the Bible can sense G-d's reality through their **conscience** and the **world around them**.

G-d has left His fingerprints everywhere: in the stars, in the seasons, in our desire for justice, and even in the ache for something greater.

## G-d Revealed in Scripture and in the Messiah (Special Revelation)

### Hebrews 1:1–3

> “In the past, G-d spoke to our ancestors through the prophets... but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son.”
> G-d used many ways to speak in the past—but His **clearest and final word** is **Yeshua**.

### John 1:1–18

Yeshua is called the **Word**—meaning He is **G-d’s message in human form**. He is eternal, divine, and through Him all things were created. When we look at Yeshua, we see G-d clearly.

### Mark 12:35–37

In a powerful moment, Yeshua quotes from the Psalms to reveal that the promised Messiah is not just David’s son—He is **David’s L-RD**. Yeshua reveals **who G-d really is** through Scripture, and in **His own identity**.

## Can We Trust the Bible?

Yes. Christians believe the Bible is not just another religious book—it is **G-d’s written revelation**.

As it says in **2 Timothy 3:16–17**:

> “All Scripture is breathed out by G-d and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.”

And in **2 Peter 1:20–21**, we read:

> “No prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation... but men spoke from G-d as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”

This means:

- The Bible is **inspired** (it comes from G-d)
- It is **infallible** (it doesn’t fail to tell the truth)
- It is **inerrant** (it contains no error in what it teaches)

Through the Scriptures, we not only learn **about** G-d—we come to **know** Him personally.

## Why Revelation Matters

Understanding how G-d reveals Himself changes everything:

- **We are not alone.** G-d made the first move to reach out to us.
- **We have no excuse to ignore Him.** Even creation and conscience point us toward G-d.
- **We need the Bible to truly know Him.** Nature shows us there is a G-d, but **only Scripture reveals His name, His plan, and His Son**.
- **Yeshua is the full picture.** To know G-d fully, we must know **Yeshua, the Messiah**, who is G-d made flesh.

## Final Thoughts

G-d has revealed Himself to all people—first in **creation**, then in **Scripture**, and most clearly in **Yeshua the Messiah**. Creation tells us **there is a G-d**. The Bible tells us **who He is**. And Yeshua shows us **what He’s like**.

> “The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory...”
> _(John 1:14)_

To ignore G-d's revelation is to close our eyes to truth. But to receive it is to find **life, purpose, and eternal hope**.
