## Can We Really Know God?

People throughout history have asked:
**Is there a God? And if so, how do we know who He is?**

The Bible’s answer is this: **Yes, God exists—and He has made Himself known**. He is not distant or hidden. In fact, the story of the Bible is the story of a God who **reveals** Himself, not just to a few, but to the whole world. And the fullest revelation of God is found in **Jesus (Yeshua), the Jewish Messiah**.

## Two Ways God Reveals Himself

The Bible shows us that God reveals Himself in two main ways:

### 1. **General Revelation**

This is how God shows Himself through the **natural world** and in **every human heart**.

### 2. **Special Revelation**

This is how God speaks more directly—through **Scripture**, the **prophets**, and most clearly, through **Yeshua (Jesus)**.

Let’s look at both of these.

## God Revealed in Creation (General Revelation)

### Genesis 1

From the very beginning, God reveals His power by **speaking the universe into existence**. Every star, ocean, animal, and person was made by Him—and for Him.

### Psalm 19

> “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.”
> Creation isn’t silent—it **shouts** about God’s greatness, beauty, and order.

### Romans 1–2

The Apostle Paul says that **God’s eternal power and divine nature** are clearly seen through what has been made. Even people who have never read the Bible can sense God's reality through their **conscience** and the **world around them**.

God has left His fingerprints everywhere: in the stars, in the seasons, in our desire for justice, and even in the ache for something greater.

## God Revealed in Scripture and in the Messiah (Special Revelation)

### Hebrews 1:1–3

> “In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets... but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son.”
> God used many ways to speak in the past—but His **clearest and final word** is **Yeshua (Jesus)**.

### John 1:1–18

Jesus is called the **Word**—meaning He is **God’s message in human form**. He is eternal, divine, and through Him all things were created. When we look at Jesus, we see God clearly.

### Mark 12:35–37

In a powerful moment, Jesus quotes from the Psalms to reveal that the promised Messiah is not just David’s son—He is **David’s Lord**. Jesus reveals **who God really is** through Scripture, and in **His own identity**.

## Can We Trust the Bible?

Yes. Christians believe the Bible is not just another religious book—it is **God’s written revelation**.

As it says in **2 Timothy 3:16–17**:

> “All Scripture is breathed out by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.”

And in **2 Peter 1:20–21**, we read:

> “No prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation... but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”

This means:

* The Bible is **inspired** (it comes from God)
* It is **infallible** (it doesn’t fail to tell the truth)
* It is **inerrant** (it contains no error in what it teaches)

Through the Scriptures, we not only learn **about** God—we come to **know** Him personally.

## Why Revelation Matters

Understanding how God reveals Himself changes everything:

* **We are not alone.** God made the first move to reach out to us.
* **We have no excuse to ignore Him.** Even creation and conscience point us toward God.
* **We need the Bible to truly know Him.** Nature shows us there is a God, but **only Scripture reveals His name, His plan, and His Son**.
* **Jesus is the full picture.** To know God fully, we must know **Yeshua, the Messiah**, who is God made flesh.

## Final Thoughts

God has revealed Himself to all people—first in **creation**, then in **Scripture**, and most clearly in **Yeshua the Messiah**. Creation tells us **there is a God**. The Bible tells us **who He is**. And Jesus shows us **what He’s like**.

> “The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory...”
> *(John 1:14)*

To ignore God's revelation is to close our eyes to truth. But to receive it is to find **life, purpose, and eternal hope**.
