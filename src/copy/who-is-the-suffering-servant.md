_"See, my servant will be successful; he will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted. Just as many were appalled at you—his appearance was so disfigured that he did not look like a man, and his form did not resemble a human being—so he will sprinkle many nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of him, for they will see what had not been told them, and they will understand what they had not heard. Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the L-RD been revealed? He grew up before him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground. He didn’t have an impressive form or majesty that we should look at him, no appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering who knew what sickness was. He was like someone people turned away from; he was despised, and we didn’t value him. Yet he himself bore our sicknesses, and he carried our pains; but we in turn regarded him stricken, struck down by G-d, and afflicted. But he was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds. We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the L-RD has punished him for the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, he did not open his mouth. He was taken away because of oppression and judgment, and who considered his fate? For he was cut off from the land of the living; he was struck because of my people’s rebellion. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, but he was with a rich man at his death, because he had done no violence and had not spoken deceitfully. Yet the L-RD was pleased to crush him severely. When you make him a guilt offering, he will see his seed, he will prolong his days, and by his hand, the L-RD’s pleasure will be accomplished. After his anguish, he will see light and be satisfied. By his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many, and he will carry their iniquities. Therefore I will give him the many as a portion, and he will receive the mighty as spoil, because he willingly submitted to death, and was counted among the rebels; yet he bore the sin of many and interceded for the rebels."_
**(Isaiah 52:13-53:12)**

## Shalom, beloved brothers and sisters,

Isaiah 53 is a radiant jewel in the Hebrew Scriptures, revealing the heart of G-d’s redemptive plan through a Servant who suffers, dies, and rises to bring atonement and peace. This passage has stirred the souls of our Jewish people for centuries, and with love and unwavering confidence, I proclaim that it points unmistakably to Yeshua of Nazareth, the Messiah who bore our sins. Let us explore this sacred text together, not to debate, but to embrace the truth of G-d’s Word in Yeshua.

## The Suffering Servant: Not Israel Alone, but Yeshua

Some Jewish traditions, including revered sages like Rashi and Ibn Ezra, interpret Isaiah 53 as describing Israel’s collective suffering in exile. Truly, our people have endured unimaginable affliction, shining as a light to the nations through their faithfulness. Yet, with respect, this view falls short of the prophecy’s full weight. Isaiah 53 speaks not of a nation but of a singular figure: “_He_ was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering who knew what sickness was… _He_ was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities” (Isaiah 53:3–5). The consistent use of singular pronouns—“he,” “him,” “his”—points to an individual, not a collective.

This individual is none other than Yeshua, the Messiah. The New Covenant confirms this truth, with Matthew 8:17 tying Yeshua’s healing ministry to Isaiah 53:4 and Philip in Acts 8 declaring that Isaiah 53 speaks of Yeshua, who was crucified and rose again. G-d’s Word is clear: Yeshua is the Suffering Servant who fulfilled this prophecy.

## The Servant’s Mission: Atonement Through Yeshua’s Sacrifice

Isaiah 53 unveils a breathtaking mission: “He was pierced because of _our_ rebellion, crushed because of _our_ iniquities; punishment for _our_ peace was on him” (Isaiah 53:5). The Servant suffers not for His own sins but as a substitute for ours, echoing the Temple’s sacrificial system yet surpassing it. Only Yeshua, who lived a sinless life and offered Himself on the tree, perfectly fulfills this role. He alone bore the sins of Israel and the world, securing atonement and peace through His blood.

No other figure—neither Israel as a nation nor any other individual—can fulfill this prophecy’s demand for a sinless substitute who dies and rises to justify many (Isaiah 53:11). Yeshua’s life, death, and resurrection align precisely with Isaiah’s vision, confirming He is the Messiah.

## Ancient Jewish Insights and the Suffering Messiah

Even within Jewish thought, the idea of a suffering Messiah is not foreign. Some rabbinic texts speak of “Messiah ben Joseph,” a figure who suffers and dies before the triumphant “Messiah ben David.” The Targum of Isaiah 52:13 declares, “Behold, My Servant, the Messiah, will prosper,” linking the Servant to the Messiah. These ancient insights, though not universal, affirm that Isaiah 53’s vision of a suffering redeemer resonates within our tradition. Yet only Yeshua fulfills this role, as He suffered, died, and rose again, exactly as Isaiah foretold.

## Yeshua: The Fulfillment of Isaiah 53

Beloved, Isaiah 53 is G-d’s unmistakable portrait of Yeshua, the Messiah who came to bear our sins. He was despised, rejected, and pierced for our transgressions, just as the prophet declared. His resurrection fulfills the promise that “out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied” (Isaiah 53:11), and His return will bring the full redemption we long for. No other interpretation captures the depth of this prophecy, for only Yeshua embodies the sinless Servant who atones for all.

## A Loving and Urgent Call to Faith

Dear friend, the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has spoken through Isaiah, revealing His Messiah, Yeshua, who bore your sins and mine on the tree. The door of salvation is open now, for Jew and Gentile alike. As Isaiah 55:6 urges, “Seek the L-RD while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.” The time to recognize Yeshua as the Suffering Servant is now, for He has fulfilled G-d’s promise of atonement, and His return as King draws near.

With all my heart, I urge you to read Isaiah 53 and seek the L-RD. Ask Him to reveal His truth, and you will find the Messiah who loves you and gave Himself for you. The peace and righteousness promised in Isaiah are yours in Yeshua today.

In the boundless love and truth of Yeshua,

A servant of Israel’s Messiah.
