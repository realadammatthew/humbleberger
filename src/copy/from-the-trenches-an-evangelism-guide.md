# From the Trenches: A Practical Guide to Prayer and Street Outreach

## A Quick How-To On Street Outreach

### Humbleberger Ministries

## Introduction

Outreach isn't reserved for the uniquely gifted; it's the call of every believer. Whether you're reaching out to your neighbor, your coworker, or people on the street, the mission remains the same: to proclaim the transformative love of Messiah Yeshua with humility, grace, and boldness, trusting the Holy Spirit to work in hearts (Romans 1:16).

This guide provides a practical, Spirit-filled roadmap for sharing the Good News through prayer and street outreach both at home and in public venues.

## Core Principles

### 1. Gospel-Centered

- **The Message:** G-d's holiness, human sin, Messiah's sacrificial death and resurrection, and the invitation to repentance and faith.
- **The Power:** Trust in the Good News itself as the power of G-d for salvation (Romans 1:16).

### 2. Spirit-Led

- Rely on the Holy Spirit for wisdom, boldness, and divine appointments (Acts 4:31, Ephesians 5:18).

### 3. Loving and Pastoral

- Engage with compassion. Listen attentively, avoid judgmentalism, and always point people to Yeshua (John 3:17; 1 Corinthians 13:1).

### 4. Humble and Respectful

- Every person is an image-bearer of G-d (Genesis 1:27). Approach each one with dignity and respect, even when you disagree (1 Peter 3:15).

### 5. Prayer-Focused

- Prayer is your most powerful tool. Pray before, during, and after conversations (James 5:16).

## Preparation: Before You Go

### Spiritual Preparation

- **Prayer:** Spend dedicated time daily asking G-d for boldness and guidance.
- **Scripture Meditation:** Memorize key B\'rit Hadasha verses (John 3:16, Romans 5:8, 2 Corinthians 5:17).
- **Testimony Practice:** Prepare a 1-minute personal testimony: life before Messiah, your encounter with Yeshua, and how He has changed you.
- **Fasting (Optional):** Consider fasting as a way to seek G-d's power and clarity (Mark 9:29).

### Practical Preparation

- **Training:** Participate in role-plays and workshops to practice conversations.
- **Team Formation:** Always work in teams of 2-3 for safety and encouragement.
- **Supplies:** Bible, water, sunscreen, comfortable clothing, B\'rit Hadasha tracts, and Synagogue contact cards.

## On the Field: How to Engage

### Approach

- Smile, make eye contact, and greet warmly.
- Use openers like:

  - "Hi! We’re here sharing G-d’s love. May I ask about your spiritual journey?"
  - "Can we offer you a prayer today?"

### Conversations

- **Listen First:** Reflect back what people share (e.g., "It sounds like you’ve been hurt by Synagogue before.")
- **Empathize:** "I'm so sorry you’ve experienced that. Can I share how Yeshua changed my life?"
- **Share the Good News Simply:**

  - G-d loves you and desires a relationship with you (John 3:16).
  - We all sin and fall short of G-d’s standard (Romans 3:23).
  - Yeshua died and rose again to offer forgiveness (Romans 5:8).
  - We are called to repent and trust in Him (Acts 3:19).

- **Invite a Response:** "Would you like to pray to trust Yeshua today?"

### Handling Hostility

- De-escalate with phrases like:

  - "I hear you and respect your perspective. I’ll pray for you."
  - "I'm sorry we're not connecting today. May G-d give you peace."

- Never argue or raise your voice (Proverbs 15:1).

## Prayer Ministry: Offering Prayer

### Setting Up a Prayer Station

- Use clear, inviting signage like "Free Prayer" with chairs for comfort.
- Offer practical kindness like water or snacks along with prayer.

### How to Pray

- Ask permission: "May I pray for you?"
- Keep prayers short, Spirit-led, and focused on G-d’s love and peace.
- Sample prayer: "Father, thank You for \[name]. Please bring peace to their situation and reveal Your love. In Yeshua's name, Amen."
- Always offer follow-up contact info for your Synagogue or small group.

## After the Event: Follow-Up and Discipleship

### Debrief as a Team

- Share testimonies, pray together, and discuss lessons learned.
- Check on each other’s emotional and spiritual well-being.

### Follow-Up with Contacts

- Contact anyone who expressed interest promptly (within 48 hours).
- Invite them to Bible studies, coffee meetings, or Synagogue services.
- Connect them with pastoral support and discipleship resources.

### Celebrate G-d’s Work

- Share anonymized testimonies with your Synagogue to glorify G-d and encourage others to join the mission.

## Safety Guidelines

- Stay in teams of 2-3.
- Check in with team leaders regularly.
- Avoid isolated or unsafe areas.
- Carry emergency contact info.
- Respect boundaries and walk away from hostile encounters.

---

## What to Avoid

### Do Not:

- Condemn or use fear-based language ("You're going to hell!").
- Engage in political or cultural debates.
- Affirm sin ("G-d loves you just as you are; no need to change.").
- Ask invasive questions ("Are you gay? Do you need to be fixed?").

Always keep the focus on Yeshua's love and the hope of transformation through the Good News.

## Conclusion

Outreach is not about winning arguments but about winning souls. It’s about faithfully planting seeds and trusting G-d to bring the increase (1 Corinthians 3:6-7). Whether on the streets, at home, or with friends and family, G-d calls you to be His ambassador of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:20). Go with grace, courage, and love, knowing that the Holy Spirit goes before you.

**"The Good News is the power of G-d for salvation to everyone who believes."** (Romans 1:16)
