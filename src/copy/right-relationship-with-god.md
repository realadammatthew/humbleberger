_"For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. Instead, you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father!”"_
**(Romans 8:15)**

## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is Our Way to God!

Beloved, to be in right relationship with God is the deepest longing of the human heart, a call to walk in intimacy with the Creator of Israel and all the world. The Tanakh and the New Covenant together reveal that this relationship is not earned by human effort but graciously given through faith in Yeshua, the Messiah. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua’s life, death, and resurrection secure our standing before God, uniting us to Him as beloved children**. Let us explore this truth, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His promises.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Covenant of Closeness

The Hebrew Scriptures establish God’s covenant (brit) with Israel, a sacred bond of mutual love and faithfulness. From Abraham’s call—“I will be your God, and you shall be My people” (Genesis 17:7)—to Sinai’s commandments (Exodus 19:5-6), God invites Israel into relationship through obedience to His Torah. Yet, the prophets foretold a deeper fulfillment:

- **Jeremiah 31:31-33**: “I will make a new covenant… I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.”
- **Ezekiel 36:26-27**: “I will give you a new heart… and I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes.”
- **Isaiah 53:5-6**: The Suffering Servant, pierced for our sins, bears our iniquities to restore us to God.

These promises point to a Messiah who would renew the covenant, not through external works but by transforming hearts and bridging the gap caused by sin.

## Yeshua: The Fulfillment of the Covenant

Dear friend, Yeshua is the mediator of the new covenant, fulfilling the Tanakh’s promises. The New Covenant reveals Him as:

- **The Perfect Sacrifice**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… and by His wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). Yeshua’s death atones for sin, satisfying God’s justice (Romans 3:25).
- **The Risen Savior**: His resurrection proves His victory over sin and death, securing our justification (Romans 4:25).
- **The Living Mediator**: “There is one mediator between God and men, the man Messiah Yeshua” (1 Timothy 2:5). Through Yeshua, we are united to God, adopted as His children (Galatians 4:4-5).

In Yeshua, we are not slaves striving to earn God’s favor but sons and daughters welcomed into His family. The Holy Spirit seals this adoption, enabling us to cry, “Abba, Father!” (Romans 8:15). This is the heart of right relationship: union with Yeshua, through whom we receive forgiveness, righteousness, and intimacy with God.

## The Jewish Perspective: A Covenant of Works

With love, we acknowledge our Jewish brethren’s understanding of right relationship through the covenant of Sinai. Rabbinic tradition teaches that faithfulness to the mitzvot—Torah study, prayer (tefillah), and acts of kindness (gemilut chasadim)—maintains the bond with God. Maimonides emphasized teshuvah (repentance) as the path to restore this relationship, citing Malachi 3:7: “Return to Me, and I will return to you.” Liturgies like the Shema and Yom Kippur’s vidui express this commitment, while Shabbat and festivals reinforce God’s presence.

Yet, the Tanakh reveals that human efforts fall short: “All our righteousnesses are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). The repeated sacrifices of the Temple could not fully cleanse (Hebrews 10:1-4), pointing to a greater need—a Messiah who fulfills the Law perfectly. Yeshua completes this covenant, offering what no amount of mitzvot can: a heart transformed by God’s Spirit and a righteousness imputed by faith (Galatians 2:16).

## Why Yeshua’s Work Matters

Yeshua’s finished work transforms our relationship with God:

- **Justification by Faith**: “A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Messiah Yeshua” (Galatians 2:16). Yeshua’s righteousness is credited to us, making us right with God.
- **Adoption as Children**: Through Yeshua, we are “heirs of God and fellow heirs with Messiah” (Romans 8:17), welcomed into His family.
- **Transformation by the Spirit**: The Holy Spirit indwells believers, empowering us to live holy lives (Titus 2:14). Sanctification flows from justification, not as a work to earn favor but as a fruit of grace.
- **Eternal Communion**: “I will never leave you nor forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5). Yeshua’s mediation ensures unbroken fellowship with God.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua for Right Relationship

Beloved, right relationship with God is found in Yeshua alone. He fulfills the Torah and the prophets, offering a new covenant written on the heart. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Jeremiah 31**, **Isaiah 53**, **Ezekiel 36**, **Psalm 51**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua does not abandon your Jewish heritage; it completes it, embracing the One who fulfills God’s promises. His sacrifice, not our works, secures our standing before God.

## Final Word: Yeshua, Our Eternal Mediator

Yeshua is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6), the One who brings us into right relationship with God. **Hebrews 7:25** declares, “He is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.” The covenant is fulfilled in Him, and His Spirit transforms us into His likeness.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, we are forever reconciled to God!**
