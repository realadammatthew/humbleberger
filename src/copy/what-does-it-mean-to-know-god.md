# What Does It Mean to Know G-d?

## A Brief Book Review

### Humbleberger Ministries

In our busy world, it's easy to confuse knowing _about_ G-d with actually _knowing_ G-d. We read books, attend Messianic Synagogue, listen to sermons, and perhaps accumulate facts about G-d. But J.I. Packer, in his beloved book _Knowing G-d_, gently invites us to something far deeper, far richer: a living relationship with our Creator that warms the heart and transforms the soul.

Packer begins by drawing a crucial distinction: _"One can know a great deal about G-d without much knowledge of Him."_ We can fill our minds with correct doctrine, yet still miss the heart of the Christian life. True knowledge of G-d is not merely intellectual; it is deeply personal and relational. It's not just about gathering information but about being known by G-d and growing in love for Him.

At the very center of knowing G-d is a relationship of love. Packer reminds us, _"Knowing G-d is more than knowing about Him; it is a matter of dealing with Him as He opens up to you."_ This is not a cold, distant acquaintance. It is warm fellowship, much like a child enjoys with a loving father. Through the work of Messiah, we are adopted into G-d's family, welcomed into His presence not as strangers, but as beloved sons and daughters.

This relationship brings profound transformation. As Packer beautifully puts it, those who know G-d will experience:

- **Great energy for G-d** — a vibrant passion to serve Him.
- **Great thoughts of G-d** — an ever-deepening wonder at His majesty and grace.
- **Great boldness for G-d** — courage to live for Him, even in difficulty.
- **Great contentment in G-d** — a steady peace that anchors the soul.

This transformation doesn't happen overnight. It grows over time, as we walk with G-d through joys and sorrows, victories and trials. His covenant love sustains us, assuring us that He is always for us. Packer writes, _"The peace of G-d is first and foremost peace with G-d; it is the state of affairs in which G-d, instead of being against us, is for us."_

But Packer also gently warns that genuine relationship with G-d must be grounded in truth. Knowing G-d rightly means knowing Him as He has revealed Himself in Scripture. Sound doctrine serves as the guardrails that protect our relationship with Him from error and lead us into greater awe and intimacy.

Ultimately, to know G-d is to discover the very purpose for which we were made. It's not merely an academic pursuit but the heartbeat of the Christian life: to love G-d and be loved by Him. Packer’s words offer a comforting assurance: _"There is no peace like the peace of those whose minds are possessed with full assurance that they have known G-d, and G-d has known them."_

In a world overflowing with information, Packer’s _Knowing G-d_ calls us back to simplicity and depth. To know G-d is to find rest for our weary souls, joy for our hearts, and purpose for our lives. May we not settle for mere facts about G-d, but seek to walk with Him daily, delighting in His presence and basking in His faithful love.
