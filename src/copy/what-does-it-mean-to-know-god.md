# What Does It Mean to Know God?

**A Brief Book Review**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

In our busy world, it's easy to confuse knowing *about* God with actually *knowing* God. We read books, attend church, listen to sermons, and perhaps accumulate facts about God. But J.I. Packer, in his beloved book *Knowing God*, gently invites us to something far deeper, far richer: a living relationship with our Creator that warms the heart and transforms the soul.

Packer begins by drawing a crucial distinction: *"One can know a great deal about God without much knowledge of Him."* We can fill our minds with correct doctrine, yet still miss the heart of the Christian life. True knowledge of God is not merely intellectual; it is deeply personal and relational. It's not just about gathering information but about being known by God and growing in love for Him.

At the very center of knowing God is a relationship of love. Packer reminds us, *"Knowing God is more than knowing about Him; it is a matter of dealing with Him as He opens up to you."* This is not a cold, distant acquaintance. It is warm fellowship, much like a child enjoys with a loving father. Through the work of Messiah, we are adopted into God's family, welcomed into His presence not as strangers, but as beloved sons and daughters.

This relationship brings profound transformation. As Packer beautifully puts it, those who know God will experience:

* **Great energy for God** — a vibrant passion to serve Him.
* **Great thoughts of God** — an ever-deepening wonder at His majesty and grace.
* **Great boldness for God** — courage to live for Him, even in difficulty.
* **Great contentment in God** — a steady peace that anchors the soul.

This transformation doesn't happen overnight. It grows over time, as we walk with God through joys and sorrows, victories and trials. His covenant love sustains us, assuring us that He is always for us. Packer writes, *"The peace of God is first and foremost peace with God; it is the state of affairs in which God, instead of being against us, is for us."*

But Packer also gently warns that genuine relationship with God must be grounded in truth. Knowing God rightly means knowing Him as He has revealed Himself in Scripture. Sound doctrine serves as the guardrails that protect our relationship with Him from error and lead us into greater awe and intimacy.

Ultimately, to know God is to discover the very purpose for which we were made. It's not merely an academic pursuit but the heartbeat of the Christian life: to love God and be loved by Him. Packer’s words offer a comforting assurance: *"There is no peace like the peace of those whose minds are possessed with full assurance that they have known God, and God has known them."*

In a world overflowing with information, Packer’s *Knowing God* calls us back to simplicity and depth. To know God is to find rest for our weary souls, joy for our hearts, and purpose for our lives. May we not settle for mere facts about God, but seek to walk with Him daily, delighting in His presence and basking in His faithful love.
