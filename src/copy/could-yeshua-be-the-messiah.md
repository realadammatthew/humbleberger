_"I continued watching in the night visions, and suddenly one like a son of man was coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was escorted before him. He was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, so that those of every people, nation, and language should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed."_
**(Daniel 7:13-14)**

## _Shalom_, beloved friends,

The heart of our Jewish faith pulses with longing for the Messiah promised in the Hebrew Bible. With unwavering love and urgency, we proclaim a transformative truth: Yeshua of Nazareth is that Messiah, the one our prophets foretold, who fulfilled the Scriptures through his life, death, and resurrection, and will return to reign in glory. As followers of Yeshua, rooted in the sacred Tanakh, we invite you to confront this question with courage: Has the Messiah come, and is he calling you today? With hearts full of grace, let us dive into the Scriptures and declare the undeniable truth of Yeshua, the Anointed One.

## The Messiah Unveiled: One Savior, Two Comings

The Tanakh reveals a Messiah who is both a reigning king and a suffering servant, a truth only Yeshua fulfills. He is the Son of David, destined to rule with justice and bring peace to all nations (Isaiah 9:6-7; Jeremiah 23:5; Daniel 7:13-14). Yet, he is also the servant pierced for our sins, bearing our guilt to redeem us (Isaiah 53; Psalm 22; Zechariah 12:10). Some rabbis, confused by this duality, imagined two messiahs—Messiah ben Joseph to suffer, Messiah ben David to reign. But the Scriptures proclaim one Messiah, Yeshua, who comes twice: first to die for our redemption, then to establish his eternal kingdom. Any other interpretation misses the clear testimony of God’s Word. Let’s examine the evidence.

## Isaiah 53: The Servant Who Redeems Us

Isaiah 53 paints a vivid portrait of a servant despised, pierced, and led like a lamb to slaughter, bearing our sins to bring forgiveness. Some claim this servant is Israel, but the text’s singular pronouns (“he was wounded for _our_ transgressions”) and substitutionary language point unmistakably to an individual. Ancient rabbis, as noted in the Talmud (Sukkah 52a), saw this as the Messiah. Yeshua’s crucifixion fulfills every detail: rejected by men, pierced on the cross, buried with the wicked yet in a rich man’s tomb (Matthew 27:57-60). To deny this fulfillment is to overlook the Tanakh’s clear prophecy. Yeshua is the servant who redeems us through his suffering.

## Psalm 22: The Pierced One in Agony

Psalm 22 describes a righteous sufferer mocked, surrounded by enemies, with hands and feet pierced and garments divided by lots. Yeshua, on the cross, quoted its opening cry: “My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46). The details of his crucifixion—piercing, mockery, and lots for his clothing (John 19:23-24)—match this psalm with astonishing precision. To attribute this to coincidence or another figure is to ignore the Tanakh’s prophetic power. Yeshua is the pierced one of Psalm 22.

## Micah 5:2: Born in Bethlehem, Eternal in Origin

Micah 5:2 declares that the Messiah will come from Bethlehem, David’s city, with origins “from ancient days.” The Targum Jonathan, an ancient Jewish translation, confirms this as a Messianic prophecy. Yeshua was born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1), and his eternal origin points to his divine nature (John 1:1). No other figure in history matches this prophecy. Denying Yeshua’s fulfillment requires dismissing Micah’s clear words.

---

## Daniel 7: The Son of Man in Glory

Daniel 7:13-14 envisions “one like a son of man” coming with the clouds, receiving eternal dominion and worship. Rashi and other Jewish scholars identify this as the Messiah. Yeshua called himself the Son of Man (Mark 14:62) and will return in glory to fulfill this vision (Revelation 1:7). To reject him as this figure is to miss the Tanakh’s promise of a divine Messiah.

---

## Zechariah 12:10: The Pierced One Mourned

Zechariah 12:10 foretells a day when God says, “They will look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for Him as for an only son.” The Talmud applies this to Messiah ben Joseph. Yeshua’s crucifixion fulfills this prophecy, and his return will bring Israel’s repentance and recognition (Romans 11:26). To interpret this as anything but Yeshua is to sidestep the Tanakh’s clarity.

## Objections Answered with Truth and Love

Some raise objections to Yeshua’s Messianic claim, but the Scriptures provide clear answers:

- **“The world is not at peace.”** The Tanakh shows two Messianic roles. Yeshua’s first coming brought peace with God through his atoning death (Isaiah 53:5). His second coming will establish universal peace (Isaiah 2:4; Micah 4:3). The kingdom has begun in the hearts of those who trust him, Jew and Gentile alike. To demand peace now is to misunderstand the Tanakh’s timeline.
- **“He did not rebuild the Temple.”** Yeshua declared himself the true Temple (John 2:19-21), providing direct access to God through his sacrifice. The physical Temple’s destruction, which he foretold (Matthew 24:2), confirms his words. Believers now form God’s living Temple (Ephesians 2:19-22), and Yeshua will fulfill all restoration prophecies at his return. To wait for a physical Temple is to miss the greater reality.

- **“The Messiah must be a descendant of David.”** The Gospels trace Yeshua’s lineage to David through both Joseph (legally) and Mary (biologically) (Matthew 1:1-16; Luke 3:23-38). Crowds hailed him as “Son of David” (Matthew 21:9). Denying his Davidic descent ignores the evidence.

- **“The Messiah cannot be divine.”** The Tanakh says otherwise: Isaiah 9:6 calls him “Mighty God,” Jeremiah 23:6 names him “The LORD our Righteousness,” and Daniel 7 shows him receiving worship. Yeshua is not a second god but God himself revealed in the Messiah. To reject his divinity is to limit God’s revelation.

- **“Most Jews have not accepted him.”** Isaiah 53:1 asks, “Who has believed our report?” Psalm 118:22 speaks of the stone rejected by the builders. A faithful remnant believed in Yeshua, and many Jewish people today are turning to him. Romans 11:26 promises that “all Israel will be saved.” Rejection does not negate the truth.

These objections, while sincere, crumble under the weight of Scripture. To cling to them is to miss the Messiah standing before us in the pages of the Tanakh.

## A Loving and Urgent Call

Beloved friends, we share this truth with hearts overflowing with love: Yeshua is the Messiah, the fulfillment of God’s promises to Israel. The Tanakh’s prophecies converge on him alone—born in Bethlehem, pierced for our sins, risen from the dead, and coming again in glory. No other figure in history matches this portrait. If not Yeshua, then who?

We urge you to read the Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—as Jewish texts rooted in the Tanakh. See Yeshua as the Son of David, the Prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15), and the Suffering Servant. Pray to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: “Reveal Your Messiah to me.” As Zechariah 12:10 promises, one day Israel will look on the One they pierced and mourn, embracing their Savior. Why wait for that day?

Trust in Yeshua today. He is your Messiah, your hope, and your coming King. His love calls you to redemption now.

_Shalom_ and blessings,

Humbleberger Ministries
