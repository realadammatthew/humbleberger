# Could Yeshua Be the Messiah Prophesied in the Hebrew Bible?

**Let's explore the Hebrew Scriptures together and find out!**

My dear Jewish friends,

This is a question that sits at the very heart of our shared longing: Has the Messiah come? Could Yeshua of Nazareth truly be the one our prophets foresaw? As a follower of Yeshua, rooted in my love for the Hebrew Scriptures, I invite you to gently consider this question with me. Let us explore the prophecies that have stirred Jewish hearts for centuries and see whether Yeshua may indeed fulfill them.

### The Puzzle of Messiah in the Hebrew Bible

The Tanakh presents us with a remarkable portrait of Messiah—but one that seems to carry two distinct themes. On one hand, we read of a glorious king from David's line who will rule in justice and bring peace to all nations (Isaiah 9:6-7; Jeremiah 23:5; Daniel 7:13-14). On the other, we encounter a suffering servant who will be rejected, afflicted, pierced, and die for the sins of others (Isaiah 53; Psalm 22; Zechariah 12:10). For centuries, rabbis have wrestled with this duality. Some even proposed two messiahs: one to suffer (Messiah ben Joseph) and one to reign (Messiah ben David).

Early Jewish followers of Yeshua came to a different conclusion: that these seemingly opposite portraits describe **one Messiah who comes twice** — first to suffer for sin, and later to reign in glory. Could this be the solution? Let's look more closely.

### Isaiah 53: The Suffering Servant

Isaiah 53 offers a breathtaking picture: a servant who is despised, pierced, and led like a lamb to slaughter, yet whose suffering brings healing and forgiveness. Traditional Jewish interpretations today often see Israel itself as the suffering servant. But historically, some ancient rabbis understood this servant to be the Messiah. The Talmud (Sukkah 52a) refers to Messiah ben Joseph being pierced, citing this very chapter.

Yeshua's death on the cross uncannily reflects Isaiah 53: He was rejected, pierced, and bore our griefs. His grave was with the wicked (crucified between criminals), yet buried in a rich man's tomb. Christians believe this was not coincidence, but fulfillment.

### Psalm 22: The Pierced One

Psalm 22 vividly describes a righteous sufferer mocked, surrounded by enemies, whose hands and feet are pierced, and whose clothes are divided by casting lots. Yeshua quoted this psalm as He hung on the cross: "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" The details of His crucifixion mirror this psalm with startling precision.

### Micah 5:2: Born in Bethlehem

Micah foretells that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem, David's city, and that His origins are "from ancient days." The Targum Jonathan, an ancient Jewish translation, explicitly names this as a messianic prophecy. Yeshua was born in Bethlehem, fulfilling this expectation, while His eternal origin points to His divine nature.

### Daniel 7: The Son of Man

Daniel sees a vision of "one like a son of man" coming with the clouds, receiving authority and worship from all peoples forever. Many Jewish commentators, including Rashi, identify this figure as the Messiah. Yeshua referred to Himself as this Son of Man and declared that He would return in glory. Christians see this as a description of Yeshua’s heavenly exaltation and future reign.

### Zechariah 12:10: The Pierced One Who Is Mourned

Zechariah speaks of a day when God says, "They will look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for Him as for an only son." Remarkably, some Talmudic sources apply this to Messiah ben Joseph. Christians see in Yeshua's crucifixion the piercing, and look forward to the day when Israel will recognize Him and mourn in repentance.

### Objections Considered with Respect

**"But the world is not at peace."**

Yes, Messiah's mission has two stages. Yeshua's first coming dealt with sin, offering peace with God (Isaiah 53:5). His second coming will bring the universal peace we long for (Isaiah 2:4, Micah 4:3). The kingdom has already begun spiritually, as Gentiles and Jews come to worship the God of Israel through Messiah.

**"But He did not rebuild the Temple."**

Yeshua identified Himself as the true Temple (John 2:19-21). Through His atoning sacrifice, He opened direct access to God. The physical Temple was destroyed, as He foretold, but believers now become the living Temple of God’s Spirit (Ephesians 2:19-22). At His return, Christians believe He will fulfill the prophecies of restoration fully.

**"But the Messiah must be a descendant of David."**

The Gospels trace Yeshua's lineage both legally (through Joseph) and biologically (through Mary) to David. Adoption carried full legal rights in Jewish law, and many acknowledged Him as "Son of David" during His ministry.

**"The Messiah cannot be divine."**

This is perhaps the most sensitive issue. Yet the Hebrew Scriptures hint at a divine Messiah: Isaiah 9:6 calls Him "Mighty God," Jeremiah 23:6 names Him "The LORD our Righteousness," and Daniel 7 shows Him receiving worship. Christians do not worship a second god but believe that God, in His oneness, has revealed Himself in the Messiah as fully divine.

**"Why have most Jews not accepted Him?"**

The prophets foresaw this too. Isaiah 53:1 asks, "Who has believed our report?" Psalm 118:22 speaks of the stone the builders rejected. Yet a faithful remnant did believe, and many Jewish people today are discovering Yeshua as their Messiah. Paul writes that one day, "all Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26).

### A Loving Invitation

Dear friend, I do not share these things lightly. I know well the cost and complexity of considering Yeshua. But I share them because I am convinced by the Scriptures, by history, and by personal relationship with the God of Israel through Yeshua that He is indeed our promised Messiah.

What if the Messiah has already come, bringing atonement, and is coming again to complete the work? What if the sufferings of Isaiah 53 and the triumph of Isaiah 9 belong to the same person in two stages?

I invite you to read the prophecies for yourself. Ask God sincerely: "If Yeshua is the Messiah, reveal it to me." Many have prayed this, and many have found Him to be the fulfillment of Israel's hope.

As Zechariah 12:10 promises, a day is coming when all Israel will look upon the One they pierced and mourn—but also rejoice, for His wounds bring our healing.

**Yeshua HaMashiach—He is our hope, our atonement, and our coming King.**

With love and respect,

A fellow seeker of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
