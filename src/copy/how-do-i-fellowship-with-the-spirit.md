## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Messiah’s Call to Relationship

The Hebrew Scriptures reveal God’s desire for a personal relationship with His people, pointing to the Messiah who makes it possible:

- **Genesis 1:26-27**: “Let us make man in our image.” God creates humanity for relationship, reflecting His love and purpose.
- **Exodus 34:6-7**: “The LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.” God seeks covenant love with His people.
- **Jeremiah 31:31-33**: “I will make a new covenant… I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.” The promised new covenant offers intimate communion.
- **Isaiah 53:5**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… by his wounds we are healed.” The Suffering Servant brings us near to God through His sacrifice.

These verses foreshadow Yeshua, the Messiah who fulfills God’s desire for a personal relationship with you, made possible through His atoning work.
