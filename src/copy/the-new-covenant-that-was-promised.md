# The New Covenant that was Promised

**A deep dive into Jeremiah's Promise of a New Covenant**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

Shalom, dear brothers and sisters,

The words of the prophet Jeremiah are rich with both sorrow and hope. He lived through terrible days for our people, watching Jerusalem fall and the First Temple destroyed. Yet in the midst of his weeping, God gave him a beautiful promise—a promise that has spoken to hearts for centuries. That promise is what we read in Jeremiah 31:31-34, where God announces that He will make a "New Covenant" with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

Today, I invite you to explore this tender promise with me. Not to debate, but to gently consider: What is this New Covenant? And what might it mean for us today?

### The Promise of a New Covenant

"Behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah."

In the Hebrew text, God says He will make a *brit chadashah* — literally, a "new covenant." This is the only time in all of the Tanakh that this phrase appears. God speaks not to strangers, but to His chosen people, both Israel and Judah. This covenant is not given to replace the people, but to restore them.

### A Covenant Unlike the One at Sinai

"Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD."

The covenant at Mount Sinai was glorious. God gave us His Torah—His teaching, His ways for living. But, tragically, we broke that covenant many times. We turned to idolatry, injustice, and rebellion. Yet, God remained like a faithful husband to His people, even when they were unfaithful.

Now, He promises something new. Not a different set of laws, but a new way of relating to those laws.

### The Law Written on the Heart

"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people."

What a tender image! Instead of the Torah written on stone tablets, God promises to write His law directly on our hearts. The Torah will not be an external list of rules but an internal desire to walk in His ways. Imagine a world where every Jew, every person, desires to love God and neighbor naturally, from the inside out. This is the heart of the New Covenant—a deep, intimate relationship with God where obedience flows from transformed hearts.

### Universal Knowledge of God and Complete Forgiveness

"And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."

Here is a beautiful picture of the world as it should be. Everyone, young and old, knowing God personally. No more need for mediators or distant teachers—each person will have a direct relationship with the Creator. And at the core of this promise is forgiveness. God promises to fully forgive our sins and to remember them no more.

### How Has This Been Understood?

In Jewish tradition, many of our sages have seen this as a promise for the Messianic Age—a future time when Israel will be fully restored, sin will be no more, and the Torah will be perfectly kept by all. Rashi and other commentators explain that this New Covenant does not replace the Torah but ensures it will be kept forever.

Yet, this raises a gentle question: *How will God bring about such perfect forgiveness and transformation of hearts?* Our long history shows that human willpower alone has never been enough to keep the Torah fully. We still struggle. We still sin.

### Could This Be Pointing to the Messiah?

For my Christian and Messianic Jewish friends, Jeremiah's New Covenant points directly to the work of the Messiah—specifically, to Yeshua. They believe that in Yeshua, God has inaugurated this New Covenant by providing full atonement through His sacrificial death, as foretold in Isaiah 53. At the Last Supper, Yeshua Himself spoke of "the new covenant in My blood," echoing Jeremiah's prophecy.

They see the Holy Spirit writing the Torah on hearts, enabling believers to live righteously, not by external compulsion, but by inward transformation. For them, Yeshua fulfills both the forgiveness of sins and the intimate knowledge of God that Jeremiah promised.

### A Gentle Invitation

Dear friend, I share this not to pressure but to invite you to consider: *Could it be that the Messiah has already come to begin this New Covenant?* Could Yeshua be the One who offers complete forgiveness and writes God's Torah upon our hearts?

The promise of Jeremiah 31 remains open. It is a covenant made with Israel and Judah, not discarded or replaced. And it offers us what every human heart longs for: forgiveness, intimacy with God, and a life transformed from within.

May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob guide us as we seek Him. May He open our hearts to the fullness of His promises.

"Seek the LORD while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near" (Isaiah 55:6).

With love and respect,

A fellow seeker of Israel’s Messiah.
