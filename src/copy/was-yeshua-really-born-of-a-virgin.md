# Was Yeshua Really Born of a Virgin?

**A Gentle Conversation for My Jewish Friends**

Among the bold claims of the New Testament, few are more surprising than this: Yeshua was born of a virgin. For many in the Jewish community, this is difficult to accept. The idea of a virgin birth doesn't fit the traditional expectations for Messiah. But if we take a fresh look at the Scriptures and the meaning behind this claim, we may find it speaks more deeply to the hopes of Israel than we first realize.

### What the Hebrew Scriptures Teach

The Hebrew Bible does hint at something extraordinary regarding the Messiah's birth. In Isaiah 7:14, the prophet says: "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the young woman (*almah*) will conceive and bear a son, and will call his name Immanuel." While *almah* means "young woman," it typically refers to a maiden of marriageable age, normally a virgin. When Jewish scholars translated Isaiah into Greek (the Septuagint) two centuries before Jesus, they rendered *almah* as *parthenos*, meaning "virgin." They clearly saw the possibility of a miraculous conception.

Even more, Isaiah 9:6 describes a child who will be called "Mighty God" and "Prince of Peace," and Jeremiah 23:5-6 speaks of a Davidic king whose name will be "The Lord Our Righteousness." These titles suggest a Messiah who is not merely human but embodies God's very presence.

### What the New Testament Says

Matthew and Luke both record that Yeshua's mother, Mary (Miriam), conceived by the Holy Spirit before she and Joseph were married. The angel Gabriel told Mary, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you... therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God" (Luke 1:35). Joseph, reassured by an angel, took Mary as his wife but "knew her not until she had given birth to a son" (Matthew 1:25).

These accounts are strikingly Jewish in their tone and steeped in Hebrew prophetic expectation. They do not reflect pagan myths but rather present a real, historical event. Unlike pagan stories of gods impregnating women, these accounts maintain God's holiness and Mary's purity. There was no sexual act—only the sovereign creative power of God.

### Addressing Common Jewish Objections

**"The Messiah wasn't supposed to be born of a virgin."**

It's true that most ancient Jewish interpreters did not expect a virgin birth. But God's ways often exceed our expectations. Many missed that Messiah would suffer (Isaiah 53). Similarly, the virgin birth was not what people expected, but in hindsight, it beautifully fits God's pattern of doing what only He can do.

**"God can't become man."**

The incarnation challenges us, but the Hebrew Bible contains hints of God drawing near. The *Shekinah* dwelt with Israel in the Tabernacle. Isaiah 9 calls the Messiah "Mighty God." Ezekiel spoke of God dwelling with His people. The incarnation fulfills God's repeated promise: "I will dwell among them."

**"'Almah' doesn't mean virgin."**

While *almah* means "young woman," its use in Isaiah 7:14 leaves open the possibility of virginity. The Septuagint’s use of *parthenos* (virgin) shows this understanding long predated Christianity. Matthew draws from this tradition, seeing the virgin birth of Yeshua as the ultimate fulfillment of Isaiah’s sign to the house of David.

### Why the Virgin Birth Matters

The virgin birth isn’t just an oddity—it’s central to Yeshua’s mission:

1. **It shows salvation is entirely God's work.** Just as no man contributed to Jesus' conception, so our salvation comes solely from God, not human effort.

2. **It allows Jesus to be fully God and fully man.** Born of Mary, He shares our humanity. Conceived by the Spirit, He is truly divine. Only this union allows Him to fully represent both God and man.

3. **It ensures His sinlessness.** Because He was not conceived in the usual way, He did not inherit Adam’s sinful nature. As the angel said, "the child... will be called holy."

4. **It fulfills the hope of Immanuel—God with us.** Through the virgin birth, God did indeed come near, not in fire and thunder, but in the quiet miracle of a baby born to a Jewish maiden.

### A Gentle Invitation

Dear reader, I invite you to ponder: Could it be that the God of Israel, who so often worked through surprising means, brought His Messiah into the world in this unexpected way? The virgin birth, far from being foreign to Jewish thought, resonates with the prophetic longing for God to intervene personally in Israel’s redemption.

In Yeshua’s birth, we see both His humanity—born of a daughter of Israel—and His divinity—conceived by the Spirit of the Holy One. This miraculous beginning prepared the way for His perfect life, His atoning death, and His victorious resurrection.

The promise of Immanuel is not abstract. It’s God’s declaration that He is not distant. He has come near—in the person of Yeshua—to bring salvation to His people.

May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob guide you as you consider these things. "Nothing will be impossible with God" (Luke 1:37).
