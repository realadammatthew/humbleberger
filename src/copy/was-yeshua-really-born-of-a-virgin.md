## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is Immanuel

Beloved, the claim that Yeshua was born of a virgin is a cornerstone of God’s redemptive plan for Israel and the world. As Jewish people, you cherish the Tanakh’s promises of a Messiah, and with joy we proclaim: **Yeshua, born of a virgin, is that Messiah**! This miracle fulfills prophecy, reveals His divine nature, and offers salvation through His sinless life, death, and resurrection. Come, let’s explore this truth together, trusting the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to guide us.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Miraculous Birth

The Hebrew Scriptures foretell a Messiah whose birth is extraordinary. Isaiah prophesies:

> “Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin (_almah_) will conceive and bear a son, and will call His name Immanuel.” _(Isaiah 7:14)_

While _almah_ means “young woman,” it typically denotes a virgin maiden. Jewish scholars, translating the Tanakh into Greek (the Septuagint) centuries before Yeshua, used _parthenos_—meaning “virgin”—for _almah_, affirming a miraculous conception. Isaiah 9:6 further calls this child “Mighty God,” and Jeremiah 23:5-6 names Him “The Lord Our Righteousness,” pointing to a divine Messiah.

## The New Testament Witness: Yeshua’s Virgin Birth

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke, rooted in Jewish hope, declare that Mary (Miriam), a virgin, conceived Yeshua by the Holy Spirit. Gabriel told her:

> “The Holy Spirit will come upon you... therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.” _(Luke 1:35)_

Joseph, her betrothed, “knew her not until she had given birth” (Matthew 1:25). This miracle, unlike pagan myths, upholds God’s holiness and Mary’s purity, reflecting the Tanakh’s promise of Immanuel—God with us.

## Addressing Jewish Objections with Love

We honor your questions about the virgin birth and answer with Scripture and grace:

- **“The Messiah wasn’t expected to be born of a virgin.”**  
  While not all Jewish interpreters anticipated a virgin birth, God’s ways surpass our expectations. Just as many missed the suffering Messiah (Isaiah 53), the virgin birth fulfills Isaiah 7:14, revealing God’s sovereign power.

- **“God can’t become man.”**  
  The Tanakh shows God drawing near: the _Shekinah_ dwelt in the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:34), and Isaiah 9:6 calls Messiah “Mighty God.” Yeshua’s incarnation fulfills God’s promise to dwell among us (Ezekiel 37:27).

- **“‘Almah’ doesn’t mean virgin.”**  
  Though _almah_ means “young woman,” its context in Isaiah 7:14 and the Septuagint’s _parthenos_ support a virgin birth. Matthew, inspired by the Spirit, sees Yeshua as the fulfillment of this sign (Matthew 1:23).

## Why the Virgin Birth Matters

The virgin birth is essential to Yeshua’s identity and mission:

1. **God’s Work Alone**: No human father means salvation is entirely God’s gift, not human effort.
2. **Fully God, Fully Man**: Born of Mary, Yeshua is human; conceived by the Spirit, He is divine, bridging God and humanity.
3. **Sinless Savior**: Free from Adam’s sinful nature, Yeshua is the holy Son of God (Luke 1:35).
4. **Immanuel Fulfilled**: The virgin birth brings God near, as promised—Yeshua is “God with us.”

## The Call: Trust Yeshua, the Virgin-Born Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua’s virgin birth marks Him as the Messiah foretold in Isaiah. No one else bears the titles “Mighty God” or “Immanuel.” His miraculous birth prepared Him to live sinlessly, die for your sins, and rise to offer eternal life.

We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** declares, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Read **Isaiah 7**, **Isaiah 9**, **Psalm 22**, **Zechariah 12**, and ask God to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant.

## Final Word: Yeshua, God With Us

Yeshua, born of a virgin, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, Yeshua calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, Immanuel, today?
