## Shalom, beloved brothers and sisters,

The Hebrew Scriptures sing of redemption—a divine promise woven through the Torah and Prophets, revealing God as our Redeemer who rescues, restores, and forgives. With unwavering confidence and tender love, I proclaim that Yeshua of Nazareth is the Messiah, the ultimate _Go’el_ who fulfills God’s redemptive plan for Israel and the world. Let us journey through the Tanakh together, seeing how Yeshua brings the promise of redemption to its glorious completion, and let us embrace the truth of His salvation today.

## The Meaning of Redemption

Redemption in the Hebrew Scriptures is God’s act of rescuing His people from slavery, danger, and sin, often at a great cost. The Hebrew words reveal its depth:

- **Go’el (גּאֵל)** — the kinsman-redeemer who restores family and inheritance.
- **Padah (פָּדָה)** — to ransom or set free.
- **Kapar (כָּפַר)** — to atone, covering sin to restore relationship with God.

These truths shine throughout Scripture:

- God redeemed Israel from Egypt’s bondage (Exodus 6:6).
- The Jubilee restored land to its rightful owners (Leviticus 25).
- Boaz redeemed Ruth and Naomi’s family line (Ruth 4).
- The High Priest atoned for Israel’s sins on Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16).

Redemption is the heartbeat of God’s covenant love, and it finds its ultimate fulfillment in Yeshua, our Redeemer.

## Redemption in the Prophets: Fulfilled in Yeshua

The prophets proclaimed a future redemption beyond political restoration—a cleansing from sin, a renewed relationship with God, and an age of peace. Isaiah declared, “Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine” (Isaiah 43:1). Jeremiah promised a New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31–34), and Isaiah foresaw swords turned into plowshares (Isaiah 2:4). These promises find their source in Yeshua, who through His death and resurrection provides forgiveness, reconciliation, and the hope of eternal peace. He is the Redeemer who fulfills the prophets’ vision.

## Yeshua: The Ultimate Redeemer

Yeshua is Israel’s _Go’el_, fulfilling the Tanakh’s redemptive patterns with divine precision:

- As the Passover lamb (Exodus 12), Yeshua shed His blood during Passover, securing eternal deliverance (John 1:29).
- As the kinsman-redeemer (Ruth 4), He restores our spiritual inheritance, redeeming us from sin’s curse.
- As the Yom Kippur sacrifice (Leviticus 17:11), Yeshua offered His own blood, securing eternal atonement as our great High Priest (Hebrews 9:12).
- As Isaiah’s Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53), He was “pierced for our transgressions,” bearing our sins to bring healing.

Through His sacrificial death and resurrection, Yeshua provides the ultimate redemption—forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God—available now to all who trust in Him.

## Addressing Objections

Some Jewish sages argue that the Messiah cannot be Yeshua, as the Temple remains in ruins, exiles persist, and global peace is unfulfilled. With deep respect, these objections overlook the dual nature of messianic prophecy. Yeshua’s first coming fulfilled the promises of atonement and spiritual restoration (Isaiah 53, Jeremiah 31), while His return will bring the physical restoration of Israel, the rebuilt Temple, and worldwide peace (Isaiah 11, Ezekiel 37). Ancient Jewish thought, including references to a suffering “Messiah ben Joseph” and a victorious “Messiah ben David,” supports this two-fold mission. Yeshua alone fulfills both roles, having suffered for our sins and soon returning as King.

## A Loving and Urgent Call to Faith

Beloved, redemption is both national and personal, and Yeshua is the Redeemer who fulfills it all. Psalm 130:7–8 declares, “With the LORD there is steadfast love, and with Him is plentiful redemption. And He will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.” Yeshua has paid the ransom price with His life, offering forgiveness and a restored relationship with God. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has spoken through His Word, and Yeshua is its living fulfillment.

With all my heart, I urge you to seek the Lord in the Scriptures. Read Isaiah 53, Jeremiah 31, and Psalm 130, and ask God to reveal His truth. As Isaiah 55:6 urges, “Seek the LORD while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.” The time to embrace Yeshua, your Redeemer, is now, for His salvation is available today, and His return draws near.

In the boundless love and truth of Yeshua,

A servant of Israel’s Messiah.
