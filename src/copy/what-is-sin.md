## What Is Sin?

Dear friend, we live in a world broken by injustice, selfishness, and pain. The Bible reveals the root of this brokenness: **sin**. Sin isn’t just doing bad things—it’s a spiritual condition that separates us from God, infecting every part of our lives. But here’s the glorious truth: God loves you too much to leave you in this state. Through **Yeshua, the Messiah**, He offers the only way to forgiveness, healing, and eternal life.

## Where Did Sin Come From?

In **Genesis 3**, Adam and Eve, our first parents, chose to disobey God, tempted by Satan to go their own way. That rebellion broke humanity’s perfect relationship with God, bringing **sin and death** into the world. Since then, every person is born with this sinful nature—we don’t need to learn how to sin; it’s woven into who we are apart from God.

## What Does Sin Do?

Sin’s consequences are devastating:

- **It separates us from God.** Like Adam and Eve’s exile from the Garden, sin cuts us off from our Creator.
- **It taints everything.** Even our best efforts fall short, as Isaiah says, “All our righteous acts are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6).
- **It distorts our perspective.** Proverbs warns, “There is a way that seems right to a person, but in the end it leads to death” (Prov. 14:12).
- **It spreads.** Sin corrupts families, communities, and nations, leaving brokenness in its wake.

## Does the Bible Say Everyone Has Sinned?

Yes, without exception:

> “There is no one righteous, not even one... all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” _(Romans 3:10, 23)_

This truth isn’t meant to crush you but to awaken you. Whether you’ve lived rebelliously or tried to be “good,” you share the same need for a Savior. Even **King David** confessed, “There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 53:3).

## Is There Any Hope?

Yes, and His name is **Yeshua**! The Bible declares:

> “While we were still sinners, the Messiah died for us.” _(Romans 5:8)_

God’s love triumphs over sin’s power. He sent **Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah**, to live a sinless life, die on the cross for your sins, and rise from the dead, defeating sin and death forever. There is no other way to be reconciled to God but through faith in Him (John 14:6). Will you trust Him today?

## What Happens When We Trust in Yeshua?

When you place your faith in Yeshua, everything changes:

1. **You are forgiven.** Every sin—past, present, and future—is washed away by His blood.
2. **You are made alive.** Ephesians 2 says you were “dead in your sins,” but now you’re alive in Messiah.
3. **You are set free.** Sin’s grip is broken, and you can live with hope, peace, and purpose.
4. **You are transformed.** God begins reshaping your heart to reflect His Son.

---

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding sin shows us our desperate need for Yeshua. Conviction of sin isn’t about guilt—it’s God’s kindness leading you to repentance (Romans 2:4). Without seeing our need, we’d never reach for the Savior. **Yeshua alone** can heal what sin has broken. Don’t wait—turn to Him now and find the life you were created for.

## Final Thoughts

Sin is real, and its effects are all around us—in the world and in our hearts. But God’s love is greater. Through **Yeshua the Messiah**, God runs toward sinners like you and me, offering forgiveness and restoration. Come to Him today, confess your sins, and trust in His finished work on the cross.

> “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” _(1 John 1:9)_

Dear friend, Yeshua is calling you. Will you answer?
