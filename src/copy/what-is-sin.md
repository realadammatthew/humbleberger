## What Is Sin?

We live in a world full of brokenness. We see injustice, violence, selfishness, and pain all around us. But the Bible teaches that the root cause of all of it is something deeper—something inside us. That problem is called **sin**.

**Sin is not just doing bad things—it’s the condition of being separated from God.** It is a spiritual sickness that touches every part of human life. And yet, the good news is that God hasn’t left us in this condition. Through **Jesus (Yeshua), the Messiah**, God offers us a way back to healing and wholeness.

## Where Did Sin Come From?

The Bible tells us that sin entered the world in the very beginning. In **Genesis 3**, Adam and Eve—humanity’s first parents—chose to disobey God. They were tempted by Satan, and they decided to go their own way instead of trusting their Creator.

That one act brought a deep brokenness into the human story. From that moment, **sin and death became part of human nature**. Every person born since has inherited this condition—we don’t have to learn how to do wrong; it comes naturally.

## What Does Sin Do?

Sin has real consequences:

* **It separates us from God.** Just like Adam and Eve were removed from the Garden, our relationship with God is broken.
* **It affects everything.** The prophet Isaiah said, “All our righteous acts are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). Even the good things we try to do fall short of God's perfect standard.
* **It distorts how we see the world.** We often think we’re doing what’s right, but Proverbs reminds us that “there is a way that seems right to a person, but in the end it leads to death” (Prov. 14:12).
* **It spreads.** Sin doesn’t just live in individuals—it shows up in families, communities, nations, and systems.

## Does the Bible Say Everyone Has Sinned?

Yes. The Bible is very clear:

> “There is no one righteous, not even one... all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”
> *(Romans 3:10, 23)*

This isn’t meant to shame us—it’s meant to tell the truth. We’re all in the same boat. Whether we’ve lived a wild life or tried to be “a good person,” we still carry a nature that’s broken.

Even **King David**, one of Israel’s greatest leaders, said:

> “There is no one who does good, not even one.” *(Psalm 53:3)*

---

## Is There Any Hope?

Yes—and this is the heart of the message of Jesus (Yeshua). The Bible says:

> “While we were still sinners, the Messiah died for us.” *(Romans 5:8)*

Sin may be powerful, but God’s love is stronger. God sent His Son, **Yeshua**, the Jewish Messiah, to live a perfect life and take the penalty for our sin by dying on the cross. But death did not win—**He rose from the dead**, defeating sin and death once and for all.

Through **faith in Him**, anyone can be forgiven and made new.

## What Happens When We Trust in the Messiah?

When we trust in Jesus, a few incredible things happen:

1. **We are forgiven.** Our sins—past, present, and future—are washed away.
2. **We are made alive.** Ephesians 2 says we were “dead in our sins,” but now we are spiritually alive.
3. **We are set free.** Sin no longer has to control us. We can live in a new way—with hope, peace, and purpose.
4. **We are changed.** God begins a lifelong work of changing our hearts so we become more like Him.

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding sin isn’t about making people feel guilty. It’s about helping us recognize **why we need saving**, and why **Yeshua is so important**. If we think we’re fine on our own, we won’t reach out for help. But once we realize how deep the problem goes, we can finally turn to the only One who can truly fix it.

## Final Thoughts

Sin is real. We see its effects every day—in the world and in our own hearts. But God did not leave us stuck. **The story of the Bible is the story of a God who runs toward sinners**, not away from them.

Through **Jesus the Messiah**, we can be forgiven, freed, and restored to the relationship with God we were always meant to have.

> “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
> *(1 John 1:9)*
