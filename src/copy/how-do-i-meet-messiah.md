## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Jewish Messiah’s Invitation

The Hebrew Scriptures foretell a Jewish Messiah who draws near to His people, preparing the way for a personal encounter:

- **Isaiah 53:5-6**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” The Suffering Servant offers atonement, inviting us to know Him.
- **Jeremiah 29:13**: “You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” God promises to be found by those who seek Him.
- **Psalm 16:11**: “You reveal the path of life to me; in Your presence is abundant joy.” God’s presence brings fullness of life.
- **Isaiah 55:6-7**: “Seek the LORD while He may be found; call to Him while He is near.” The call to encounter God is urgent and personal.

These verses point to Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah who fulfills the Tanakh’s promises and invites you to meet Him today through faith.

## Yeshua: The Jewish Messiah Who Meets You Personally

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah who seeks a personal relationship with you:

- **The Gospels Reveal Yeshua**: The Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are your gateway to knowing Yeshua. Start with the Gospel of John or Matthew in the CSB translation, a clear and faithful rendering of His life and words. John 15:4-5 says, “Remain in me, and I in you… I am the vine; you are the branches.” Reading these accounts brings you face-to-face with Yeshua’s heart.
- **Faith Alone Saves**: “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Yeshua is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). There’s nothing else you need—no works, no rituals—just a personal encounter with Yeshua through faith.
- **Born Again for Eternal Hope**: “Yeshua replied, ‘Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God’” (John 3:3). Meeting Yeshua transforms you, granting eternal life through a spiritual rebirth.
- **Community Amplifies His Presence**: Joining a local church or Messianic congregation brings you into fellowship where Yeshua’s presence is felt powerfully. Acts 2:42-47 shows early believers meeting together, experiencing God’s presence in community.

Today, grab a CSB Bible and read John 1 and Matthew 5. Find a local church—whether Christian or Messianic—and attend an in-person service to worship and pray with others. This is where Yeshua meets you, offering salvation and hope through faith alone.
