## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Jewish Messiah’s Invitation

The Hebrew Scriptures foretell a Jewish Messiah who draws near to His people, preparing the way for a personal encounter:

- **Isaiah 53:5-6**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… the L-RD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” The Suffering Servant offers atonement, inviting us to know Him.
- **Jeremiah 29:13**: “You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” G-d promises to be found by those who seek Him.
- **Psalm 16:11**: “You reveal the path of life to me; in Your presence is abundant joy.” G-d’s presence brings fullness of life.
- **Isaiah 55:6-7**: “Seek the L-RD while He may be found; call to Him while He is near.” The call to encounter G-d is urgent and personal.

These verses point to Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah who fulfills the Tanakh’s promises and invites you to meet Him today through faith.

## Yeshua: The Jewish Messiah Who Meets You Personally

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah who seeks a personal relationship with you:

- **The Good News Reveals Yeshua**: The Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are your gateway to knowing Yeshua. Start with the Gospel of John or Matthew in the TLV translation, a clear and faithful rendering of His life and words. John 15:4-5 says, “Remain in me, and I in you… I am the vine; you are the branches.” Reading these accounts brings you face-to-face with Yeshua’s heart.
- **Faith Alone Saves**: “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Yeshua is L-RD,’ and believe in your heart that G-d raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). There’s nothing else you need—no works, no rituals—just a personal encounter with Yeshua through faith.
- **Born Again for Eternal Hope**: “Yeshua replied, ‘Truly I tell you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of G-d’” (John 3:3). Meeting Yeshua transforms you, granting eternal life through a spiritual rebirth.
- **Community Amplifies His Presence**: Joining a local Messianic Synagogue brings you into fellowship where Yeshua’s presence is felt powerfully. Acts 2:42-47 shows early believers meeting together, experiencing G-d’s presence in community.

Today, grab a TLV Bible and read John 1 and Matthew 5. Find a local Messianic Synagogue—whether Christian or Messianic—and attend an in-person service to worship and pray with others. This is where Yeshua meets you, offering salvation and hope through faith alone.
