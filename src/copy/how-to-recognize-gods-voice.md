## The Tanakh’s Testimony: G-d’s Voice Points to the Messiah

The Hebrew Scriptures reveal G-d’s desire to speak to His people, foreshadowing the Messiah’s guiding voice:

- **1 Kings 19:12**: After the earthquake and fire, G-d spoke to Elijah in a “still small voice,” showing His gentle guidance.
- **Isaiah 30:21**: “Your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, ‘This is the way, walk in it.’” G-d promises direction to those who seek Him.
- **Jeremiah 29:13**: “You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart.” G-d’s voice is found through earnest seeking.
- **Isaiah 53:1-5**: The Suffering Servant, pierced for our transgressions, speaks to lead us to healing and peace.

These verses point to Yeshua, the Messiah whose voice fulfills G-d’s promise to guide His people into truth and salvation.

## Yeshua: The Good Shepherd Whose Voice You Can Know

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Messiah who speaks to you personally through His Spirit and Word:

- **Scripture Reveals His Voice**: “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). Reading the Gospel of John unveils Yeshua’s character—His love, truth, and sacrifice (John 15:1-17). Knowing His words helps you recognize His voice, like spotting genuine currency by studying the real thing.
- **Faith Opens Your Ears**: “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Yeshua is L-RD,’ and believe in your heart that G-d raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). Trusting Yeshua begins your relationship, making His voice clear through faith alone.
- **The Holy Spirit Guides You**: “The Spirit of truth… will guide you into all truth” (John 16:13). The Holy Spirit, promised by Yeshua (John 14:26), brings peace, conviction, or promptings that align with His character, helping you discern His voice.
- **Community Confirms His Voice**: Joining a local Messianic Synagogue strengthens your ability to hear Yeshua. Acts 2:42-47 shows believers growing through fellowship, where others can confirm His guidance. Attend an in-person service to share and test what you hear.
- **Test Every Prompting**: “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace” (Galatians 5:22-23). Test thoughts or impressions against Scripture—do they promote love and truth, like Yeshua’s call to forgive (Matthew 6:14-15)? If not, they may not be His voice.

Start today: read John 10:27-30 in the TLV Bible, pray for discernment, and find a local Messianic Synagogue to worship with others. The Holy Spirit will make Yeshua’s voice clear and personal.

- **Guided by the Holy Spirit**: The Spirit, “the down payment of our inheritance” (Ephesians 1:14), helps you discern Yeshua’s voice, bringing peace and direction (John 16:13).
- **Transformed by His Voice**: Hearing Yeshua produces love, joy, and peace (Galatians 5:22-23), as you follow His teachings to love G-d and neighbor (Matthew 22:37-40).
- **Strengthened in Community**: Joining a local Messianic Synagogue fosters discernment through worship and fellowship, as seen in the early Synagogue (Acts 2:42-47). Others can confirm His voice in your life.
