## What Do Christians Mean by “Trinity”?

One of the most important—and sometimes most confusing—ideas in Christianity is the belief in the **Trinity**. Christians believe in **one G-d**, but that this one G-d exists as **three distinct persons**:

- **G-d the Father**
- **G-d the Son (Yeshua the Messiah)**
- **G-d the Holy Spirit**

This doesn’t mean we believe in three G-ds. Christianity holds firmly to the truth of **one G-d**, just as it’s written in the **Shema**:

> “Hear, O Israel: The L-RD our G-d, the L-RD is one.” _(Deuteronomy 6:4)_

So how can G-d be both **one** and **three** at the same time? Let’s break it down.

## What Does the Bible Say?

### G-d Is One

The Bible begins with the truth that there is **only one G-d**, who created everything. In **Genesis 1**, G-d speaks the universe into existence. He creates humanity in His image and gives us purpose and relationship.

### G-d Is Personal

Throughout Scripture, G-d is shown as personal—not an abstract force, but a Being who speaks, loves, acts, and enters into covenants with His people. He cares deeply about creation and especially about us.

### The Father, Son, and Spirit Work Together

In the New Covenant, we see something amazing: G-d the Father, Son, and Spirit working in perfect unity. One clear example is at **Yeshua's baptism**:

> "As Yeshua was baptized, the heavens opened, the Spirit of G-d came down like a dove, and a voice from heaven said, ‘This is My beloved Son.’" _(Matthew 3:16–17)_

All three persons of the Trinity are present:

- **The Son (Yeshua)** in the water
- **The Spirit** descending
- **The Father** speaking from heaven

## Who Is Yeshua in All This?

For those from a Jewish background, the idea of G-d becoming human can sound strange. But the Hebrew Scriptures (Tanakh) speak of a coming Messiah who would be both **G-d’s servant** and **G-d Himself** in some mysterious way (see Isaiah 9:6, Micah 5:2).

Christians believe that **Yeshua** is that promised **Jewish Messiah**. The Gospel of John starts like this:

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with G-d, and the Word was G-d... and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” _(John 1:1,14)_

Yeshua is described as:

- **Pre-existent** (He existed before He was born)
- **Divine** (He is called “G-d”)
- **Human** (He took on flesh and lived among us)

---

## Who Is the Holy Spirit?

The Holy Spirit is not just a force or energy—He is **G-d’s personal presence**. In the Tanakh, we see G-d’s Spirit involved in creation, prophecy, and power. In the New Covenant, the Spirit:

- **Guides and teaches**
- **Comforts and empowers**
- **Lives inside believers**

The Spirit is the one who gives us new life and helps us follow G-d daily.

## How Can G-d Be Three and One?

We admit: this is a **mystery**. It’s not something we can fully wrap our minds around. But it’s not a contradiction—it’s a **paradox**, something that is deeply true even if it stretches human understanding.

Here’s one way to think about it:

- G-d is **one in essence** (what He is)
- G-d is **three in person** (who He is)

All three—Father, Son, and Spirit—are:

- Fully G-d
- Eternal
- Equal in power and glory
- United in will and purpose

But each is also **distinct**. The Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit, and so on.

## Why Does It Matter?

### 1. It Shows Us What G-d Is Really Like

The Trinity reveals that **G-d is relational**. Even before creation, G-d existed in perfect love and fellowship within Himself. This is why **love** is central to who G-d is.

### 2. It Helps Us Understand Yeshua

We don’t believe that Yeshua was just a good teacher or prophet. He is **G-d in the flesh**, come to rescue humanity from sin and bring us back to Himself.

### 3. It Explains Salvation

G-d the Father **sent** the Son.
The Son **died and rose again** for us.
The Spirit **lives in us** and changes us.
Salvation is something the whole Trinity is involved in.

## Final Thoughts

Christians don’t believe in three G-ds—we believe in **one G-d who is three persons**. This belief is based on the full picture of the Bible and is at the heart of what makes Christianity unique.

We don’t claim to fully understand the Trinity, but we trust the G-d who revealed Himself in this way. And most importantly, we believe that **Yeshua** is the promised **Jewish Messiah**, and through Him, we come to know the **one true G-d**—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

> “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”
> _(Matthew 28:19)_
