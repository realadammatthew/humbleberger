## What Do Christians Mean by “Trinity”?

One of the most important—and sometimes most confusing—ideas in Christianity is the belief in the **Trinity**. Christians believe in **one God**, but that this one God exists as **three distinct persons**:

* **God the Father**
* **God the Son (Yeshua/Jesus the Messiah)**
* **God the Holy Spirit**

This doesn’t mean we believe in three gods. Christianity holds firmly to the truth of **one God**, just as it’s written in the **Shema**:

> “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” *(Deuteronomy 6:4)*

So how can God be both **one** and **three** at the same time? Let’s break it down.

## What Does the Bible Say?

### God Is One

The Bible begins with the truth that there is **only one God**, who created everything. In **Genesis 1**, God speaks the universe into existence. He creates humanity in His image and gives us purpose and relationship.

### God Is Personal

Throughout Scripture, God is shown as personal—not an abstract force, but a Being who speaks, loves, acts, and enters into covenants with His people. He cares deeply about creation and especially about us.

### The Father, Son, and Spirit Work Together

In the New Testament, we see something amazing: God the Father, Son, and Spirit working in perfect unity. One clear example is at **Jesus’ baptism**:

> "As Yeshua was baptized, the heavens opened, the Spirit of God came down like a dove, and a voice from heaven said, ‘This is My beloved Son.’" *(Matthew 3:16–17)*

All three persons of the Trinity are present:

* **The Son (Jesus/Yeshua)** in the water
* **The Spirit** descending
* **The Father** speaking from heaven

## Who Is Jesus in All This?

For those from a Jewish background, the idea of God becoming human can sound strange. But the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) speak of a coming Messiah who would be both **God’s servant** and **God Himself** in some mysterious way (see Isaiah 9:6, Micah 5:2).

Christians believe that **Yeshua (Jesus)** is that promised **Jewish Messiah**. The Gospel of John starts like this:

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” *(John 1:1,14)*

Jesus is described as:

* **Pre-existent** (He existed before He was born)
* **Divine** (He is called “God”)
* **Human** (He took on flesh and lived among us)

## Who Is the Holy Spirit?

The Holy Spirit is not just a force or energy—He is **God’s personal presence**. In the Old Testament, we see God’s Spirit involved in creation, prophecy, and power. In the New Testament, the Spirit:

* **Guides and teaches**
* **Comforts and empowers**
* **Lives inside believers**

The Spirit is the one who gives us new life and helps us follow God daily.

## How Can God Be Three and One?

We admit: this is a **mystery**. It’s not something we can fully wrap our minds around. But it’s not a contradiction—it’s a **paradox**, something that is deeply true even if it stretches human understanding.

Here’s one way to think about it:

* God is **one in essence** (what He is)
* God is **three in person** (who He is)

All three—Father, Son, and Spirit—are:

* Fully God
* Eternal
* Equal in power and glory
* United in will and purpose

But each is also **distinct**. The Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit, and so on.

## Why Does It Matter?

### 1. It Shows Us What God Is Really Like

The Trinity reveals that **God is relational**. Even before creation, God existed in perfect love and fellowship within Himself. This is why **love** is central to who God is.

### 2. It Helps Us Understand Jesus

We don’t believe that Jesus was just a good teacher or prophet. He is **God in the flesh**, come to rescue humanity from sin and bring us back to Himself.

### 3. It Explains Salvation

God the Father **sent** the Son.
The Son **died and rose again** for us.
The Spirit **lives in us** and changes us.
Salvation is something the whole Trinity is involved in.

## Final Thoughts

Christians don’t believe in three gods—we believe in **one God who is three persons**. This belief is based on the full picture of the Bible and is at the heart of what makes Christianity unique.

We don’t claim to fully understand the Trinity, but we trust the God who revealed Himself in this way. And most importantly, we believe that **Yeshua (Jesus)** is the promised **Jewish Messiah**, and through Him, we come to know the **one true God**—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

> “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”
> *(Matthew 28:19)*
