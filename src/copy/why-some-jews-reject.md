## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is the Messiah Who Calls to You!

Beloved, the question “Why do some Jewish people reject Yeshua as Messiah?” touches the heart of Israel’s hope and God’s redemptive plan. Many Jews, rooted in the Tanakh’s promises, await a Messiah who has not yet come, while others—Messianic Jews—see Yeshua as the fulfillment of those promises. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua is Israel’s promised Messiah, whose life, death, and resurrection fulfill the Torah and prophets, offering salvation to all who trust Him**. Let us explore the reasons for this rejection and the hope found in Yeshua, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Messiah’s Mission

The Hebrew Scriptures outline the Messiah’s role, setting expectations for Israel’s redeemer:

- **Isaiah 53:4-6**: “He has borne our griefs… He was pierced for our transgressions… the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” The Suffering Servant atones for sin.
- **Micah 5:2**: A ruler from Bethlehem, “whose coming forth is from of old,” will lead God’s people.
- **Psalm 16:10**: “You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let Your holy one see corruption,” pointing to resurrection.
- **Ezekiel 37:26-28**: The Messiah will establish God’s sanctuary, signaling a restored covenant.

These prophecies depict a Messiah who suffers, dies, rises, and restores Israel. For Messianic Jews, Yeshua fulfills these, but many Jews see unfulfilled expectations as a barrier.

## Yeshua: The Messiah Who Fulfills the Tanakh

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Messiah who fulfills God’s promises:

- **Prophetic Fulfillment**: Born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1-6), Yeshua suffered for humanity’s sins (1 Peter 2:24) and rose from the dead (Matthew 28:1-10), fulfilling Isaiah 53, Micah 5, and Psalm 16.
- **New Covenant Mediator**: “This cup is the new covenant in My blood” (Luke 22:20), fulfilling Jeremiah 31:31-34 by offering forgiveness through His sacrifice.
- **Spiritual Kingdom**: “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36). Yeshua’s first coming established a spiritual redemption, with physical restoration to come at His return.
- **Salvation for All**: “Whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). Yeshua’s atonement unites Jews and Gentiles in God’s family (Romans 3:29-30).

Yeshua, a Jew who observed Torah, is embraced by Messianic Jews (175,000 in the U.S., up to 1.7 million globally) as the fulfillment of their heritage, blending Jewish practices with faith in Him.

## The Jewish Perspective: Reasons for Rejection

With love, we acknowledge why many Jewish people reject Yeshua as the Messiah, rooted in theology, scripture, and history:

- **Unfulfilled Prophecies**: The Messiah is expected to rebuild the Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28), gather all Jews to Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6), and establish world peace (Isaiah 2:4). Since these await fulfillment, many Jews believe the Messiah has not yet come (Aish.com, 2009).
- **Theological Conflicts**: Yeshua’s divinity and the Trinity are misunderstood to contradict modern Judaism’s monotheism (Deuteronomy 6:4)—although this is not true, as The Shema is actually a call of exclusivity to the God of Israel and the Triune God is three-in-one as opposed to tritheism or the worship of three gods. Maimonides’ principles require a human Messiah who upholds Torah, but Yeshua’s teachings, like Sabbath healings (John 9:14), are seen as violations (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 11:4).
- **Davidic Lineage**: The Messiah must be a patrilineal descendant of David (2 Samuel 7:12-14). Yeshua’s virgin birth negates a biological father, disqualifying Him in Jewish eyes (Jews for Judaism)—this is also a misunderstanding and also ignores entirely the absolute miracle of Yeshua's virgin birth! _Who else can claim they were born of a virgin?_
- **Historical Tensions**: Centuries of Christian anti-Semitism—Crusades, pogroms, and the Holocaust—have fostered distrust. The charge of deicide and forced conversions deepen resistance to Yeshua (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum).
- **Scriptural Misinterpretations**: Jews view Christian readings of Isaiah 53 (Israel as the servant) and Isaiah 7:14 (“alma” as “young woman,” not “virgin”) as mistranslations, rooted in the collective revelation at Sinai (Deuteronomy 5:3).

Yet, the Tanakh’s promise of a Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) and a new covenant (Jeremiah 31) points to Yeshua, whose first coming fulfilled spiritual redemption, with physical restoration to follow.

## What Happens When You Trust Yeshua?

When you trust Yeshua as the Messiah, your Jewish identity is fulfilled, not forsaken:

- **Forgiveness of Sins**: “The blood of Yeshua His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). Yeshua’s sacrifice atones, fulfilling Leviticus 17:11’s requirement for blood.
- **Covenant Heir**: “If you belong to Messiah, you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). You remain part of God’s covenant with Israel.
- **Spiritual Renewal**: The Holy Spirit writes God’s law on your heart (Hebrews 8:10), empowering a life of mitzvot as fruit of faith (James 2:17).
- **Eternal Life**: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life” (John 3:36). Yeshua secures your place in God’s kingdom.

Messianic Jews continue observing Shabbat and Passover, seeing Yeshua as the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7), enriching their Jewish faith.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua as Israel’s Messiah

Beloved, though many Jews reject Yeshua due to unfulfilled expectations and historical pain, He is the Messiah who fulfills the Tanakh’s hope. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Micah 5**, **Psalm 16**, **Jeremiah 31**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, making you an heir of God’s promises. Despite challenges from community or tradition, Yeshua’s love and the Holy Spirit’s strength will uphold you.

## A Prayer to Trust Yeshua

Dear friend, if you long to see Yeshua as Israel’s Messiah, pray this prayer from your heart:

**Heavenly Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I confess my sins and seek Your redemption. I believe Yeshua is the Messiah, who died for my sins and rose again, fulfilling Your Torah and prophets. I trust in His sacrifice for my salvation. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, strengthen my Jewish identity, and guide me in Your truth. Thank You for Your love and grace. In Yeshua’s name, Amen.**

## Final Word: Yeshua, The Hope of Israel

Yeshua is the promised Messiah who completes God’s covenant with Israel. **John 1:29** declares, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah 12:10 foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you are forever God’s child, a true heir of Israel!**
