# Was Yeshua Really Sinless?

**A Message for Our Jewish Friends**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

One of the most extraordinary claims of the New Testament is that Yeshua (Jesus) lived a completely sinless life. For many, especially within the Jewish community, this is a bold claim that raises honest and important questions. How could anyone be entirely without sin? Didn't Scripture itself say, "There is no one who does not sin" (1 Kings 8:46)? Let's explore this claim together with humility, respect, and an open heart.

### What Does the Hebrew Bible Say?

The Hebrew Scriptures do emphasize that all humanity struggles with sin. Yet, at the same time, they point ahead to a uniquely righteous figure. The prophet Isaiah speaks of God's "Righteous Servant" who would suffer for the sins of others: "He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth" (Isaiah 53:9). The Messiah, it seems, would stand apart from the rest of humanity in His moral purity.

The sacrificial system offers further clues. The Passover lamb, whose blood saved Israel from death in Egypt, had to be "without defect" (Exodus 12:5). This unblemished lamb symbolized innocence and purity. The Messiah, according to the prophets, would become the ultimate Lamb—without spot or blemish—to take away the sin of the world.

### The New Testament Testimony

The New Testament builds on these themes, portraying Yeshua as the fulfillment of Isaiah’s Suffering Servant and the true Passover Lamb. His followers, who lived closely with Him for years, consistently declared that He committed no sin:

* "He committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth" (1 Peter 2:22).
* "God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us" (2 Corinthians 5:21).
* "Tempted in every way, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15).

Even those outside His circle testified to His innocence. Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, declared, "I find no fault in him." One of the criminals crucified alongside Him confessed, "This man has done nothing wrong."

### But Didn’t Jesus Break the Sabbath?

Some object that Yeshua broke Torah, for example by healing on the Sabbath. However, when we carefully read these stories, we see that He was not violating God’s law but challenging man-made traditions that had been added to it. Yeshua reminded His critics that "it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath" (Matthew 12:12). In healing on Shabbat, He was fulfilling—not breaking—the true intent of Torah: mercy, life, and restoration.

### Why Jesus Had to Be Sinless

The claim of Jesus' sinlessness is not just theological trivia—it’s central to His mission. The Torah requires that sacrificial animals be without defect; this pointed forward to a sinless Messiah who could serve as the perfect atonement for human sin. Yeshua's sinlessness qualified Him to be the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose blood brings deliverance—not just from Egypt, but from the slavery of sin.

As Isaiah prophesied, "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6). Because Yeshua was sinless, He could bear our sins. His resurrection then becomes God's ultimate affirmation that He was indeed without sin—"death could not hold Him" (Acts 2:24).

### An Invitation to Consider

I share these thoughts not to argue, but to invite reflection. If Yeshua truly lived without sin, as Scripture and history together suggest, then He is uniquely qualified to be the Messiah promised to our people. His sinlessness was not just a moral achievement—it was part of God's plan of redemption from the very beginning.

I encourage you to open the Scriptures afresh: read Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Daniel 9, and Zechariah 12. Consider whether Yeshua fits the portrait of the sinless, suffering, and ultimately victorious Messiah that these passages describe.

The question of Yeshua's sinlessness leads us to a deeper question: Could He be the One our people have long awaited? May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob give you wisdom and peace as you seek the truth.
