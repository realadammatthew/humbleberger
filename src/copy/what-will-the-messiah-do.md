_"They will live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your ancestors lived. They will live in it forever with their children and grandchildren, and my servant David will be their prince forever. I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be a permanent covenant with them. I will establish and multiply them and will set my sanctuary among them forever. My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. When my sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I, the Lord, sanctify Israel."_
**(Ezekiel 37:25-28)**

## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is the Messiah!

Beloved, as Jewish people, you hold fast to the Tanakh’s promises of a Messiah who will redeem and restore. With love and certainty, I proclaim: **Yeshua of Nazareth is that Messiah**! He has come as the Suffering Servant, atoning for sin, and will return as the Reigning King to fulfill God’s kingdom promises. Let us explore this truth together, trusting the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His Anointed One.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: Messiah’s Mission

The Hebrew Scriptures unveil a Messiah who fulfills God’s redemptive plan:

- **Davidic King**: “I will raise up for David a righteous Branch” (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 11:1). Messiah rules with justice and righteousness.
- **Bringer of Peace**: “The wolf will dwell with the lamb,” and the earth will know God (Isaiah 11:6-9; Micah 4:3-4).
- **Restorer of Israel**: He gathers Israel’s exiles and establishes peace (Ezekiel 37:21-28), with a renewed Temple (Ezekiel 40-48).
- **Judge of Nations**: The “Son of Man” receives eternal dominion (Daniel 7:13-14; Psalm 2).
- **Atoner for Sin**: The Servant is “pierced for our transgressions,” bringing healing (Isaiah 53:5).

## Yeshua’s Mission: Fulfilled and Forthcoming

Yeshua fulfills these prophecies in two divine phases:

- **First Coming: Suffering Servant**  
  Born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), from David’s line, Yeshua lived perfectly, was rejected, and crucified, fulfilling Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22. His resurrection confirms His identity: “After the suffering of His soul, He will see the light of life” (Isaiah 53:11). He became the ultimate sacrifice, atoning for sin.

- **Second Coming: Reigning King**  
  Yeshua inaugurated God’s kingdom spiritually (Luke 17:21). At His return, He will bring world peace, gather Israel, judge nations, and establish His eternal throne, fulfilling Isaiah 11, Micah 4, and Daniel 7.

## Addressing Objections with Truth

We honor your questions and answer with Scripture and love:

- **“Where’s the world peace?”** The Tanakh shows a suffering Messiah (Isaiah 53) and a reigning King (Isaiah 11). Yeshua fulfilled the first; His return will fulfill the second.
- **“Why no rebuilt Temple?”** Yeshua’s sacrifice made animal offerings obsolete (Hebrews 10:12). His followers are now God’s temple, indwelt by His Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16).
- **“Why didn’t most Jews believe?”** Isaiah 53:1 predicted rejection: “Who has believed our report?” Yet thousands of Jews followed Yeshua (Acts 2:41), and Romans 11:26 promises “all Israel will be saved.”

## The Call: Trust Yeshua, the Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua is the Messiah who atones and reigns. No one else fulfills Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Daniel 9, or Micah 5. He died for your sins, rose, and will return to complete God’s promises. We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Psalm 22**, **Daniel 7**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask God to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant.

## Final Word: The Messiah’s Work Continues!

Yeshua, the Lamb who was slain and the coming King, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, He calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
