# What Will the Messiah Do?

**Let's explore what the Scriptures say He will do here in this World**

Dear brothers and sisters,

For centuries, our people have cherished the promises of God concerning the coming of the Messiah. These promises are woven deeply into the fabric of the Hebrew Scriptures, and they stir hope in every Jewish heart. But what exactly does the Tanakh say the Messiah will do? And could some of these promises have already begun to unfold?

Let us gently explore these questions together.

### The Messiah in the Hebrew Scriptures

The Hebrew Bible paints a beautiful and complex portrait of the Messiah—the Anointed One whom God will send to deliver His people and establish His kingdom.

**A King from David’s Line**
The prophets foretell that the Messiah will descend from King David’s royal line. Jeremiah declares, "Behold, the days are coming... when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch" (Jeremiah 23:5). Isaiah echoes this hope, speaking of a "shoot from the stump of Jesse" (Isaiah 11:1), Jesse being David’s father. The Messiah will rule with perfect justice, wisdom, and righteousness.

**Bringing Peace and Knowledge of God**
Isaiah envisions a day when "the wolf will dwell with the lamb" and the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD (Isaiah 11:6-9). Micah adds that nations will beat their swords into plowshares, and none will make them afraid (Micah 4:3-4).

**Restoring Israel and Rebuilding the Temple**
The Messiah will gather the exiles of Israel and restore national peace (Ezekiel 37:21-28). Some prophecies hint at a renewed or rebuilt Temple (Ezekiel 40-48), where God's presence will dwell permanently.

**Judging the Nations**
Daniel sees a vision of "one like a Son of Man" receiving dominion and glory from God Himself (Daniel 7:13-14). Psalm 2 depicts the Messiah as God’s Son who will rule over the nations with authority.

**Atone for Sin and Bring Healing**
Perhaps most strikingly, Isaiah 53 describes a Servant who would suffer and die for the sins of others: "He was pierced for our transgressions... and by His wounds we are healed." This Servant is rejected, yet His suffering brings atonement and peace.

### The Christian Understanding: Yeshua as Messiah

As a Jewish believer in Yeshua (Jesus), I believe these prophecies are fulfilled in Him—and yet, not all at once. The Messiah’s mission unfolds in two beautiful stages:

**First Coming: The Suffering Servant**
Yeshua was born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), descended from David, and lived a life of perfect obedience to God. He was rejected by many, pierced on the cross, and willingly gave His life as an atonement for sin, fulfilling Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22. His resurrection from the dead confirmed His identity, much like Isaiah 53:11 foresees: "After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life."

**Second Coming: The Reigning King**
Many of the kingdom promises—world peace, the final gathering of Israel, universal justice, and judgment—await His return. Christians believe that Yeshua inaugurated God’s kingdom spiritually (Luke 17:21) but will fully manifest it in His second coming. As Daniel foresaw, the Son of Man will return on the clouds to receive everlasting dominion.

### Answering Honest Questions

**"If Jesus is Messiah, why is there no world peace?"**
The prophets foresaw both suffering and reigning roles for the Messiah. Yeshua fulfilled the suffering servant prophecies in His first coming and will fulfill the reigning king prophecies at His return.

**"Why didn't He rebuild the Temple?"**
In His first mission, Yeshua became the ultimate atoning sacrifice, making the physical Temple's sacrifices obsolete. The New Testament teaches that His followers now form a spiritual temple, indwelt by God's Spirit.

**"Why did most Jews not accept Him?"**
Even Isaiah asks, "Who has believed our report?" (Isaiah 53:1). The prophets predicted initial rejection. Yet many Jews did believe, and the New Testament began as a Jewish movement. Paul promises that one day "all Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26).

### A Loving Invitation to Consider

Dear friend, could it be that the Messiah has already come to deal with sin and suffering, and is coming again to bring the full peace we long for? Could the dual pictures of a suffering servant and a glorious king describe one Messiah in two stages?

The hope of Israel is not lost; it has been planted and is already bearing fruit. Yeshua fulfills the ancient promises, and His return will complete them. I encourage you to read the Scriptures anew—Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Daniel 7, Zechariah 12—and ask the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to open your eyes.

The Messiah's mission is to redeem, heal, and reign. Yeshua has already begun this work. He is the Lamb who was slain and the King who will reign forever.

With love and respect,

A fellow seeker of the God of Israel.
