# Did Yeshua Really Rise From The Dead?

**The most controversial event in all of human history**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

For many of my fellow Jewish brothers and sisters, the Christian claim that Yeshua (Jesus) rose bodily from the dead is perhaps the most difficult part of the gospel to accept. Yet, it is also the very heart of Christian faith. As Paul, himself a Torah-trained Jew, once said, "If Messiah has not been raised, your faith is futile" (1 Corinthians 15:17).

So did Yeshua really rise from the dead? And if so, what does this mean for us as Jewish people? Let's explore this together with both warmth and honesty.

### The Prophets Were Whispering All Along

Long before Yeshua walked the earth, our own Hebrew Scriptures whispered hints of resurrection:

* **Psalm 16:10** promises that God would not let His "Holy One see decay." Peter and Paul later recognized that David could not have been speaking of himself, but prophetically of Messiah, whose body would not rot in the grave.
* **Isaiah 53** describes the Suffering Servant who would be "cut off from the land of the living" for our sins, yet afterward "prolong His days" and see the light of life again. How can one die and yet prolong His days? The riddle only makes sense in light of resurrection.
* **Hosea 6:2** pictures a restoration on "the third day." This became especially meaningful as early Jewish believers saw Yeshua raised on the third day.

Even Yeshua Himself pointed to Jonah as a sign: "For as Jonah was three days and nights in the belly of the fish, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth." The idea of a Messiah who suffers, dies, and then rises was not invented later; it was there in our Scriptures all along, awaiting fulfillment.

### What The Disciples Experienced

The New Testament records that after His crucifixion, Yeshua was buried in a known tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea. On the third day, the tomb was found empty. Women were the first to discover this (an unlikely choice for fabricators in a first-century Jewish setting where women’s testimony was often discounted).

But it wasn't just the empty tomb. Many saw Yeshua alive afterward:

* Mary Magdalene in the garden.
* Peter and the other apostles.
* Over 500 people at once.
* Even skeptics like James (Yeshua's own brother) and Saul (Paul), who went from persecuting believers to proclaiming Yeshua as risen Lord.

These appearances were not hallucinations or private visions. They involved eating, touching, and extended conversations. Entire groups testified to seeing Him at the same time. The disciples, who had fled in fear, were suddenly emboldened, even to the point of dying for their message. People don't die for what they know to be a lie.

### Addressing Common Objections

Some suggest the disciples stole the body. But these same disciples willingly faced torture and execution for their proclamation. Liars make poor martyrs.

Others suggest they went to the wrong tomb. But Joseph of Arimathea’s tomb was well-known, and the authorities could have easily pointed to the right one and produced the body if it remained.

Still others suggest hallucinations. Yet hallucinations don’t appear to multiple people at once, involve physical interactions, or account for the empty tomb.

And some say perhaps the resurrection was just "spiritual" or symbolic. Yet the disciples insisted on a bodily resurrection. They proclaimed that Yeshua physically rose—His body was gone, and He stood among them.

The earliest Jewish response recorded was that the disciples stole the body, not that the body was still there. Even His enemies acknowledged the tomb was empty.

### Why This Matters Theologically

The resurrection of Yeshua is not just a miraculous event; it’s the climax of God's redemption story for Israel and the world:

* **It proves Yeshua is Messiah.** By raising Him, God vindicated Yeshua’s identity as the promised Son of David, the Suffering Servant, and the Son of God.
* **It demonstrates victory over death.** As Isaiah said, "He will swallow up death forever" (Isaiah 25:8). In Yeshua, God began this victory.
* **It guarantees our future resurrection.** Paul called Yeshua "the firstfruits"—just as He was raised, so too will all who belong to Him be raised in the world to come.
* **It secures our atonement.** His death paid for sin; His resurrection is God’s declaration that the payment was accepted. As Paul wrote, "He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification" (Romans 4:25).

### An Invitation to Consider

Dear Jewish friend, I understand the weight of this claim. It is not easy to consider that Messiah might have come—and that we, as a people, missed Him. But I invite you to examine the evidence, both from history and from our own Scriptures.

The first followers of Yeshua were all Jews. They did not abandon Judaism; they believed Yeshua was the fulfillment of the Torah and Prophets. As Peter preached in Jerusalem shortly after the resurrection: "This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses" (Acts 2:32).

The tomb was empty. The witnesses were many. The Scriptures pointed forward. The Messiah lives.

"By His wounds we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5). And because He lives, we too can live.

**HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
