## Dear Friend, Yeshua Lives!

Beloved, the resurrection of Yeshua of Nazareth is the cornerstone of God’s redemptive plan and the hope of Israel and the world. As Jewish people, you cherish the Tanakh’s promises of a Messiah, and with joy we proclaim: **Yeshua, risen from the dead, is that Messiah**! His bodily resurrection fulfills prophecy, defeats death, and offers eternal life to all who trust Him. Let’s explore this truth together, trusting the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His Messiah.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Risen Messiah

The Hebrew Scriptures foretell a Messiah who triumphs over death:

- **Psalm 16:10**: “You will not let Your Holy One see decay.” David spoke prophetically of Messiah, whose body would not rot in the grave.
- **Isaiah 53:10-11**: The Suffering Servant, “cut off” for our sins, will “prolong His days” and see life again—a clear resurrection promise.
- **Hosea 6:2**: “On the third day He will raise us up.” This foreshadowed Yeshua’s third-day resurrection.

Yeshua Himself pointed to Jonah’s sign: “As Jonah was three days and nights in the fish, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth” (Matthew 12:40). The resurrection was woven into the Tanakh, awaiting fulfillment in Yeshua.

## The Witnesses: Undeniable Testimony

The Gospels record Yeshua’s burial in Joseph of Arimathea’s tomb, which was found empty on the third day. Women, including Mary Magdalene, were the first witnesses—an unlikely detail if invented, given the era’s view of women’s testimony. Then, Yeshua appeared alive:

- To Mary Magdalene in the garden (John 20:16).
- To Peter and the apostles (Luke 24:34-36).
- To over 500 at once (1 Corinthians 15:6).
- To skeptics like James, His brother, and Saul (Paul), a persecutor turned apostle (Acts 9).

These were not visions but physical encounters—eating, touching, speaking. The disciples, once fearful, became bold, dying for their testimony. Liars don’t die for a known falsehood.

## Addressing Objections with Truth

Some claim the disciples stole the body. Yet they faced torture and death for their message—liars make poor martyrs. Others suggest a wrong tomb, but Joseph’s tomb was known, and authorities could have produced the body if it remained. Hallucinations don’t explain group sightings, physical interactions, or the empty tomb. A “spiritual” resurrection contradicts the disciples’ insistence on a bodily rising—Yeshua’s body was gone, and He stood among them (Luke 24:39).

Even His enemies admitted the tomb was empty, claiming theft (Matthew 28:13), not a body’s presence. The evidence points unmistakably to resurrection.

## Why the Resurrection Matters

Yeshua’s resurrection is the climax of God’s plan:

- **It Proves He Is Messiah**: God’s raising of Yeshua confirms Him as the Son of David and Son of God (Romans 1:4).
- **It Defeats Death**: “He will swallow up death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). Yeshua’s victory begins this promise.
- **It Secures Atonement**: “He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification” (Romans 4:25).
- **It Guarantees Our Resurrection**: As “the firstfruits” (1 Corinthians 15:20), Yeshua’s rising ensures ours.

## The Call: Trust the Risen Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua’s resurrection fulfills the Tanakh and changes everything. No one else matches Psalm 16, Isaiah 53, or Hosea 6. He alone died for your sins and rose to give you life. We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Psalm 16**, **Isaiah 53**, **Hosea 6**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask God to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant.

## Final Word: The Messiah Lives!

Yeshua, risen from the dead, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, He calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Lord, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
