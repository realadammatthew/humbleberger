# Counting the Cost: The Price for Following Yeshua

## The high price — and eternal reward — of following Yeshua as Messiah

For many Jewish people, the name "Yeshua" is not merely a name; it's a dividing line. It marks the beginning of a path that, for many, feels like walking a tightrope between rejection and redemption. And for those who are sincerely seeking truth—who are sincerely asking, "Could Yeshua really be the Messiah?"—that question doesn't come cheap. It comes with a price.

## The Cost of Following Yeshua

It's easy to speak of "salvation by grace" and "free forgiveness," and yes—salvation is a gift that no man can earn. But accepting that gift may cost more than some can bear to imagine. Because for many Jewish seekers, following Yeshua means losing everything they've known.

### Rejection from Family

Many Jewish believers in Yeshua have been cut off from family after their decision to follow Him. Some are shunned. Some are told they are no longer welcome at Shabbat dinner. In certain cases, families hold symbolic funerals, declaring the believer to be "dead" to them. The grief is real. The loss is not symbolic.

For those from Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox backgrounds, the cost can be even steeper. Some are excommunicated from their communities, kicked out of schools, or denied business relationships. And even for secular or Reform Jews, the accusation stings: "You've betrayed your people."

### Cultural and Social Loss

Jewish identity is deeply communal. To accept Yeshua as Messiah is, for many, seen as crossing an uncrossable line—a line that separates Jew from Gentile, tradition from betrayal, history from heresy. Many Jewish believers wrestle with the fear of losing their cultural heritage, of being labeled "Christian" in a way that implies they've forsaken everything Jewish.

The fear isn't hypothetical. It's based in real stories. A Jewish woman in Tel Aviv loses her job because she shared her testimony. A young man in Brooklyn finds himself suddenly without friends or family because he got baptized. A Holocaust survivor in Florida confides that her synagogue no longer welcomes her.

These are not fictional scenarios—they are the stories we carry with us. And they echo the warning of Yeshua Himself:

> "Do not suppose that I came to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword… a man's enemies will be the members of his own household." (Matthew 10:34–36)

### Internal Struggle

Even for those not outwardly persecuted, the inner battle is profound. To believe that Yeshua is the Messiah is to question years—decades—of teaching. It is to ask if maybe the rabbis were wrong. If maybe, somehow, the gospel is true. And that question is heavy, because it challenges not only religious identity but also emotional and ancestral loyalty. For many Jews, it feels like betraying grandparents, ancestors, and martyrs.

### But What If It's True?

Here is the better question: What if it's true? What if the promised Messiah really did come? What if Yeshua really is the fulfillment of the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings? What if God did so love the world that He gave His only Son?

Then the cost, no matter how heavy, is not too great.

## The Joy Set Before Us

> "For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross…" (Hebrews 12:2)

That same joy—the joy of reunion with the Father, the joy of eternal life, the joy of perfect peace—is offered to us who follow Him.

Yeshua was Jewish. His disciples were Jewish. The gospel was first preached in Jerusalem. And through Yeshua, the promises made to Abraham are fulfilled—not abolished, but fulfilled and expanded, reaching Gentile and Jew alike.

In Yeshua, Jewish identity is not lost. It is made whole.

## The Eternal Reward

> "Truly I tell you," Yeshua said, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for Me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age… and in the age to come, eternal life." (Mark 10:29–30)

There is a cost. But the reward is infinitely greater.

Not merely a better life—but eternal life. Not temporary acceptance by men, but everlasting adoption by God. Not fleeting tradition, but an unshakable Kingdom. In Messiah, Jewish believers become part of a remnant—"chosen by grace" (Romans 11:5)—a foretaste of the final ingathering when "all Israel shall be saved" (Romans 11:26).

## Real-World Restoration

Today, there are Messianic congregations in Tel Aviv, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, and even in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. Jewish believers are worshiping in Hebrew, celebrating the feasts, and walking in the light of Yeshua's love. There is a growing remnant. You are not alone.

More and more Jewish people are coming to see that to follow Yeshua is not to reject their heritage, but to fulfill it. That the Messiah they've longed for has come—not to erase them, but to save them.

## Conclusion: Worth Every Step

To our Jewish brothers and sisters: we know the weight of the decision before you. We know how deep the roots run, and how painful the pruning can be. But we also know the fruit is worth it.

Yeshua is the Messiah of Israel. He is the Lamb who was slain and the Lion of Judah who will return. In Him is not only salvation—but the fullness of what it means to be Jewish.

Don't let fear steal the joy God offers. Don't let tradition blind you to the One who fulfilled it. Count the cost—then lift your eyes.

**The reward is Messiah Himself.**
