## What Makes Us Human?

Every person at some point asks big questions like:
**Why am I here? What does it mean to be human? Is there a purpose to my life?**

The Bible gives us a clear and beautiful answer: we are made by God, in His image, with incredible value and a meaningful purpose. But we’re also broken—and in need of restoration. And that restoration comes through **Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah**.

## Created in God’s Image

The Bible begins with this bold statement:

> “God created mankind in His own image... male and female He created them.”
> _(Genesis 1:27)_

Being made in God’s image means we reflect something of who God is. That includes our ability to think, create, love, speak, and make moral choices. It also means that every human life has **infinite worth**, no matter our background, gender, status, or abilities.

## Made Male and Female

God created people as **male and female**, with both genders fully sharing in His image. This wasn’t an accident—it was His design. And He called it “very good.”
God also created **marriage** as a special relationship between one man and one woman, a partnership built for love, commitment, and the foundation of family.

## Designed for Purpose

God didn’t just make us to exist—He made us for a purpose:

- **To be in relationship with Him**
- **To care for His creation**
- **To live in community with each other**
- **To reflect His love and justice in the world**

From the beginning, God gave people meaningful work, emotional connection, and spiritual purpose.

## But Something Went Wrong

While God’s design was good, we haven’t lived up to it. We often turn away from God’s ways and choose our own path. That’s called **sin**, and it affects every part of who we are.

The result?

- We struggle in relationships
- We misuse our bodies and our gifts
- We seek identity in things that don’t last
- We forget the One who made us

Still, our **core value hasn’t changed**. We are **damaged by sin**, but not worthless. God still sees us, knows us, and loves us.

## Yeshua Shows Us True Humanity

Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah, wasn’t just fully God—He was also **fully human**. And His life shows us what **real humanity** is supposed to look like.

- He loved people deeply
- He cared for the poor and outcast
- He lived with integrity
- He depended on God completely
- He suffered real pain and showed real compassion

Yeshua is the perfect example of what it means to be human. And more than that—He came to **restore us** to what we were meant to be.

## A New Identity Through Faith

When we believe in Yeshua, we don’t just get forgiven—we get **recreated**. The Bible says:

> “If anyone is in Messiah, they are a new creation.” _(2 Corinthians 5:17)_

That means:

- Our past does not define us
- We are adopted into God’s family
- We are being shaped to become more like Yeshua
- One day, we will be raised to eternal life with new, glorified bodies

We were made for **glory**, and through Yeshua, that glory is being restored.

---

## Embracing Our Limits

One important truth the Bible teaches is that **being human means having limits**. We can’t do everything. We get tired, we need help, we make mistakes. That’s not a flaw—it’s how God made us.

In today’s world, some people try to overcome those limits through technology or self-reinvention. But the Bible tells us:
**Real strength comes from depending on God.**
Our limits are there to draw us closer to Him—not to be erased.

---

## Equal Value, Beautiful Differences

In God’s family, there is **unity and diversity**. The Apostle Paul wrote:

> “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Messiah Yeshua.” _(Galatians 3:28)_

This doesn’t mean our differences disappear. It means our identity in Messiah comes first. Everyone who belongs to Him is **equally loved, equally valued, and uniquely gifted**.

---

## Final Thoughts

To be human is a gift.
To be human is to be **made in God’s image**.
But we are also broken—and that’s why we need a Savior.

Through **Yeshua the Messiah**, we are not just forgiven; we are made whole. He shows us what humanity was meant to be. And when we follow Him, we begin to become more like Him—more fully alive, more fully human.

> “See what kind of love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God—and that is what we are!”
> _(1 John 3:1)_
