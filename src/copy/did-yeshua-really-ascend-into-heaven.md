## Dear Friend, Yeshua Reigns!

Beloved, the ascension of Yeshua into heaven is a glorious truth that fulfills G-d’s promises to Israel and the world. As Jewish people, you hold dear the Tanakh’s hope for a Messiah, and with joy we proclaim: **Yeshua, risen and ascended, is that Messiah**! His bodily ascension confirms His victory, establishes His reign, and assures His return. Let us explore this truth, trusting the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His Messiah.

## The Biblical Witness: Yeshua’s Ascension

After His resurrection, Yeshua spent 40 days with His disciples, teaching and eating with them. On the Mount of Olives, He blessed them and “was lifted up, and a cloud took Him out of their sight” (Acts 1:9). Angels declared, “This same Yeshua… will come back in the same way” (Acts 1:11). This was no vision but a physical ascent, witnessed by His Jewish followers, transforming them into bold proclaimers of the Messiah.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Messiah Exalted

The Hebrew Scriptures foretell a Messiah lifted to G-d’s presence:

- **Daniel 7:13-14**: The “Son of Man” comes “with the clouds of heaven” to receive an eternal kingdom.
- **Psalm 110:1**: “The L-RD says to my L-RD, ‘Sit at My right hand.’” This Messianic prophecy points to Yeshua’s exaltation.
- **Isaiah 52:13**: The Servant is “raised and lifted up and highly exalted” after suffering.
- **Enoch and Elijah**: Their ascensions (Genesis 5:24; 2 Kings 2:11) show G-d taking the righteous to Himself, prefiguring Yeshua’s greater ascent.

Yeshua’s ascension fulfills these prophecies, marking Him as the promised Messiah.

## Why the Ascension Matters

Yeshua’s ascension is the cornerstone of G-d’s plan:

1. **Enthroned as King**: Peter proclaimed, “G-d has made this Yeshua… both L-RD and Messiah” (Acts 2:36). He reigns from heaven, guiding history to its fulfillment.
2. **Our High Priest**: Yeshua intercedes for us, entering heaven with His atoning blood (Hebrews 4:14-16), securing forgiveness for all who trust Him.
3. **Sender of the Spirit**: On Shavuot (Pentecost), Yeshua poured out the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), empowering His followers to proclaim His name.
4. **Promise of Return**: The angels’ words assure His return to establish His kingdom on earth (Acts 1:11).

## Addressing Objections with Truth

We honor your questions and answer with Scripture and love:

- **“Isn’t the Messiah to rule on earth?”** Yes, and He will! Psalm 110 says He reigns “until” His enemies are defeated. Yeshua’s first coming atoned for sin; His return will bring the Messianic kingdom.
- **“Is this a myth?”** The Jewish disciples, risking death, proclaimed what they saw. Their testimony, rooted in the Tanakh, reflects truth, not fiction.
- **“Why so few witnesses?”** G-d often reveals wonders to chosen witnesses (e.g., Moses, Isaiah). The apostles, transformed by the ascension, became faithful proclaimers.

## The Call: Trust the Ascended Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua’s ascension confirms He is the Messiah of Daniel, Psalm 110, and Isaiah. No one else fulfills these prophecies. He died for your sins, rose, and ascended to reign, offering you salvation. We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is L-RD and believe in your heart that G-d raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Daniel 7**, **Psalm 110**, **Isaiah 52-53**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask G-d to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes G-d’s covenant.

## Final Word: The Messiah Reigns!

Yeshua, ascended to G-d’s right hand, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, He calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the exalted L-RD, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
