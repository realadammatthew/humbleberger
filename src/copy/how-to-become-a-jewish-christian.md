## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is Israel’s Messiah!

Beloved, the longing to unite your Jewish identity with faith in Yeshua, the Messiah, is a beautiful journey toward the heart of God’s redemptive plan. To become a Jewish-Christian—or, as many prefer, a Messianic Jew—is to embrace Yeshua as the promised Savior while cherishing your Jewish heritage. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Salvation comes through faith in Yeshua, who fulfills the Tanakh’s promises and invites you into God’s covenant family**. Let us explore this path together, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Messiah for Israel

The Hebrew Scriptures proclaim a Messiah who brings salvation to Israel and the nations:

- **Isaiah 53:5-6**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” The Suffering Servant atones for sin, restoring us to God.
- **Jeremiah 31:31-33**: “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel… I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.”
- **Zechariah 12:10**: Israel will “look on Me, the One they have pierced,” receiving grace through the Messiah’s sacrifice.

These prophecies point to Yeshua, who fulfills the Torah and Prophets, not abolishing them but completing them (Matthew 5:17). As a Jew, trusting Yeshua aligns with the Tanakh’s hope, embracing the One who brings God’s covenant to its fullness.

## The Path to Becoming a Jewish-Christian

To become a Jewish-Christian, you need only trust in Yeshua as Messiah and Savior. The New Covenant outlines this simple yet profound step:

- **Repent and Believe**: Acknowledge your sin and need for God’s mercy (Acts 3:19). Trust that Yeshua’s death paid for your sins and His resurrection secures your life (Romans 10:9). “By grace you have been saved through faith… it is the gift of God, not a result of works” (Ephesians 2:8-9).
- **Receive the Holy Spirit**: At the moment of faith, God’s Spirit indwells you, making you a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17) and sealing your adoption as His child (Galatians 4:6).
- **Live as Abraham’s Heir**: “Those who have faith are children of Abraham” (Galatians 3:7). Your Jewish identity is not erased but fulfilled, as you inherit the promises through Yeshua (Romans 11:29).

In practice, this faith may be expressed through a prayer of trust, confessing Yeshua as Lord and Savior. Baptism often follows as a public testimony of your faith, symbolizing union with Yeshua’s death and resurrection (Romans 6:4). You may join a Messianic congregation or a Christian church, where you can worship with others who share this faith.

## Cherishing Your Jewish Heritage

Dear friend, trusting Yeshua does not mean abandoning your Jewish identity. The first believers in Yeshua were Jews who continued to live as Jews—attending synagogue, observing Shabbat, and celebrating biblical feasts like Passover (Acts 2:46; 21:20). Today, many Messianic Jews maintain these practices, reinterpreting them in light of Yeshua:

- **Shabbat and Feasts**: You may observe Shabbat or festivals like Passover, seeing Yeshua as the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7) or the fulfillment of Shavuot through the Holy Spirit (Acts 2).
- **Jewish Customs**: Some keep kosher or use Hebrew prayers, not to earn salvation but to honor their heritage and reach others with the Gospel.
- **Scripture**: Study the Tanakh alongside the New Covenant, seeing Yeshua as the fulfillment of God’s promises to Israel.

Messianic Judaism offers a framework to live as a Jew who follows Yeshua, often blending traditional liturgy with Messiah-centered worship. You might attend a Messianic synagogue that uses a siddur with references to Yeshua or celebrates Communion during a Passover Seder.

## The Jewish Perspective: A Challenge to Consider

With love, we acknowledge the mainstream Jewish view that belief in Yeshua is incompatible with Judaism. Rabbinic tradition, rooted in halakha, considers faith in Yeshua as idolatry, viewing a Jew who trusts in Him as an apostate (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Avodat Kochavim 10:1). Orthodox and Conservative authorities often exclude such individuals from synagogue membership or communal roles, while Reform Judaism, though more open to personal belief, still sees Yeshua as outside Jewish theology. This can lead to painful consequences, such as family estrangement or exclusion from Jewish institutions.

Yet, the Tanakh’s own words challenge this view. Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 point to a Messiah who suffers and dies for sin, and Jeremiah’s new covenant promises a heart transformed by God’s Spirit. Yeshua fulfills these prophecies, not negating Jewish identity but completing it. As Romans 11:26 declares, “All Israel will be saved,” through faith in the Messiah. Trusting Yeshua does not abandon your Jewishness but fulfills the hope of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## Why Yeshua Matters for Jewish-Christians

Yeshua’s work is the cornerstone of your salvation:

- **Atonement**: His death fulfills the Yom Kippur sacrifices, providing eternal forgiveness (Hebrews 9:12).
- **New Covenant**: He writes God’s law on your heart, empowering you to live righteously (Hebrews 8:10).
- **Abraham’s Heir**: Through faith, you remain part of God’s chosen people, joined with all believers as “one new man” (Ephesians 2:15).
- **Eternal Hope**: Yeshua guarantees your resurrection and eternal life (John 11:25).

## The Call: Trust Yeshua as Your Messiah

Beloved, becoming a Jewish-Christian means trusting Yeshua as the Messiah foretold in the Tanakh. With tender urgency, we invite you to take this step. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Jeremiah 31**, **Psalm 22**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant. You may face challenges from family or community, but Yeshua’s love and the Holy Spirit’s strength will sustain you.

## Final Word: Yeshua, Israel’s Living Messiah

Yeshua is the Messiah who unites Jews and Gentiles in God’s family. **John 14:6** declares, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you are forever God’s child!**
