## Shalom, beloved brothers and sisters,

From the Torah of Moses to the visions of the prophets, the Hebrew Scriptures proclaim the hope of the Messiah—the Anointed One who redeems Israel and restores the world to God. With unwavering confidence and tender love, I declare that Yeshua of Nazareth is this Messiah, fulfilling the promises of the Tanakh with divine precision. Let us explore together how Yeshua brings the Scriptures to their glorious fulfillment, inviting you to embrace the truth of God’s Word in Him.

## Fulfillment, Not Replacement

Yeshua does not abolish the Law and the Prophets; He brings them to their perfect completion. He Himself declared, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). In Hebrew thought, fulfillment is a seed blossoming into its full flower. The Torah, sacrifices, festivals, and prophetic promises form God’s covenant story with Israel, and Yeshua is its radiant culmination. Through Him, every word of Scripture shines with divine purpose, revealing God’s unchanging love for His people.

## Prophetic Promises Fulfilled in Yeshua

The Tanakh overflows with prophecies that Yeshua has fulfilled:

- **Born in Bethlehem**: Micah 5:2 foretold a ruler from Bethlehem, and Yeshua was born there (Matthew 2:1–6), confirming His messianic identity.
- **Riding on a donkey**: Zechariah 9:9 promised Zion’s King would come humbly on a donkey, which Yeshua fulfilled entering Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1–5).
- **A suffering servant**: Isaiah 53 portrays a servant “pierced for our transgressions,” bearing the sins of many. Yeshua’s sacrificial death on the cross perfectly fulfills this prophecy.
- **Pierced and mourned**: Zechariah 12:10 declares, “They will look on Me whom they have pierced,” pointing to Yeshua’s crucifixion and the future repentance of Israel at His return.

These are but a few of the countless prophecies Yeshua has fulfilled, proving He is the Messiah promised to Israel and the world.

## The Festivals and Sacrifices Find Their Meaning in Yeshua

Our sacred calendar and sacrifices point directly to Yeshua:

- **Passover (Pesach)**: The Passover lamb’s blood saved Israel in Egypt. Yeshua, the “Lamb of God” (John 1:29), was crucified during Passover, shedding His blood for our eternal redemption.
- **Firstfruits**: The first sheaf offered to God prefigures Yeshua’s resurrection on the day of Firstfruits, as “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20).
- **Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement)**: The high priest’s annual atonement foreshadowed Yeshua, our great High Priest, who entered the heavenly sanctuary with His own blood, securing eternal forgiveness (Hebrews 9:11–12).

These holy observances are not abolished but fulfilled in Yeshua, revealing Him as the heart of God’s redemptive plan.

## The New Covenant Through Yeshua

Jeremiah 31:31–34 promised a _brit chadashah_ (New Covenant), where God would write His Torah on hearts and forgive sins forever. Yeshua inaugurated this covenant through His atoning death, declaring, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood” (Luke 22:20). Through His sacrifice and the gift of the Holy Spirit, Yeshua transforms hearts, enabling us to live out God’s Torah in love and obedience. This covenant does not replace Israel but restores her, opening salvation to all who trust in Him.

## Addressing Jewish Objections

Some Jewish sages argue that Yeshua cannot be the Messiah, noting that global peace, the rebuilt Temple, and Israel’s full restoration remain unfulfilled. With deep respect, these objections miss the dual nature of messianic prophecy. Yeshua’s first coming fulfilled the promises of atonement and heart transformation (Isaiah 53, Jeremiah 31), while His return will bring global peace and Israel’s restoration (Isaiah 11, Micah 4). Ancient Jewish thought, including texts about a suffering “Messiah ben Joseph” and a victorious “Messiah ben David,” supports this two-fold mission. Yeshua alone fulfills both roles, as the suffering servant and the coming King.

## A Loving and Urgent Call to Faith

Beloved, Yeshua is the Messiah who fulfills the Hebrew Scriptures with divine precision. He is the Lamb who bore our sins, the High Priest who offers eternal atonement, the King who will return in glory, and the Servant who brings healing through His wounds. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has spoken through His Word, and Yeshua is its living fulfillment. As Isaiah 55:6 urges, “Seek the LORD while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.”

With all my heart, I urge you to search the Scriptures and seek the Lord. Ask Him to reveal His truth, and you will find Yeshua, the Messiah who loves you and gave Himself for you. The door of salvation is open now—embrace Him today, for His return draws near.

In the boundless love and truth of Yeshua,

A servant of Israel’s Messiah.
