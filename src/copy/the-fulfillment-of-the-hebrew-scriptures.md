# Yeshua: The Fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures

## How our King Yeshua Fulfills Biblical Prophecy

### Humbleberger Ministries

Shalom, dear brothers and sisters,

From the days of Moses to the prophets of old, our people have carried a great hope—the promise of the Messiah, the Anointed One who would fulfill God's purposes for Israel and the world. Over the centuries, many have wondered: when will the Messiah come? And how will we know Him?

Today, I invite you to gently explore an important question: Could Yeshua fulfill the Hebrew Scriptures—not by replacing them, but by bringing them to fullness?

### Fulfillment, Not Replacement

When Christians speak of Yeshua "fulfilling" the Law and Prophets, they do not mean that He abolishes or erases them. Yeshua Himself said, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (Matthew 5:17).

In Hebrew thought, fulfillment means bringing something to completion—like a seed growing into its full flower. The Torah, the sacrifices, the festivals, and the promises of the Prophets all form a beautiful story of God’s covenant with Israel. Christians believe that in Yeshua, this story reaches its appointed goal.

### Prophetic Promises Realized

Throughout the Tanakh, God gave us glimpses of the Messiah:

- **Born in Bethlehem**: The prophet Micah declared that from Bethlehem would come a ruler for Israel (Micah 5:2). Yeshua was born there (Matthew 2:1-6).
- **Riding on a donkey**: Zechariah spoke of Zion’s King coming humbly on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9), which Yeshua fulfilled when entering Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1-5).
- **A suffering servant**: Isaiah 53 describes one who would be "pierced for our transgressions" and "bear the sin of many." Christians see in this the clearest portrait of Yeshua's sacrificial death on our behalf.
- **They will look on Me whom they have pierced**: Zechariah 12:10 foreshadows a day when Israel will recognize the One they pierced, leading to mourning and repentance—a hope still awaiting full realization.

These are just a few of the many prophecies Christians see as fulfilled in Yeshua’s first coming.

### The Festivals and Sacrifices Point to Him

Our sacred calendar is rich with meaning:

- **Passover (Pesach)**: The blood of the lamb protected our ancestors in Egypt. Yeshua, called "the Lamb of God" (John 1:29), was crucified during Passover, offering His own blood for our ultimate deliverance.
- **Firstfruits**: As the first sheaf was offered to God, Yeshua rose from the dead on this very day, becoming "the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" (1 Corinthians 15:20).
- **Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement)**: The high priest entered the Holy of Holies once a year with blood for atonement. Christians believe Yeshua, as our great High Priest, entered the heavenly sanctuary with His own blood, securing eternal atonement (Hebrews 9:11-12).

These observances are not abolished in Christian thought; rather, they find their fullest meaning in Yeshua.

### A New Covenant, Foretold by Jeremiah

Our prophet Jeremiah spoke of a _brit chadashah_ (New Covenant) when God would write His Torah on our hearts and forgive our iniquities (Jeremiah 31:31-34). Christians believe that through Yeshua, God has inaugurated this covenant, offering both forgiveness and inward transformation.

### Respecting Jewish Objections

Many of our Jewish sages have long objected that Yeshua did not fulfill all the Messianic promises. The Temple was destroyed, war and exile continued, and peace has not yet covered the earth. These are important concerns.

However, Christians understand that some promises were fulfilled in Yeshua's first coming (atonement, resurrection, Spirit-given heart transformation), while others await His return (global peace, full restoration of Israel). Early Jewish expectations were not uniform; even ancient rabbinic texts speak of both a suffering Messiah (Messiah ben Joseph) and a victorious King (Messiah ben David).

### An Invitation to Consider

Dear friend, could it be that Yeshua fulfills the Hebrew Scriptures not by setting them aside, but by embodying their deepest hopes? Could He be the Lamb of God who bears our sins? The King who brings peace? The Servant who suffers for our healing? The High Priest who offers eternal atonement?

I share this with deep love and respect, as a fellow seeker of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Scriptures invite us to search diligently, to wrestle, to ask God for understanding. May He open all our hearts to see the fullness of His plan.

"Seek the LORD while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near." (Isaiah 55:6)

With love,

A fellow seeker of Israel’s Messiah.
