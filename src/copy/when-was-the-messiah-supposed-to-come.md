# When Was the Messiah Supposed to Come?

**A Gentle Look at Daniel 9 for My Jewish Friends**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

Shalom, dear brothers and sisters,

Throughout Jewish history, we have longed for the coming of the Messiah—the Anointed One who would redeem Israel, bring peace to the world, and restore righteousness. The Hebrew Scriptures (Tanakh) give us many beautiful portraits of the Messiah, but one prophecy in particular offers a stunning timeline for His arrival: the famous "Seventy Weeks" prophecy found in Daniel 9.

I invite you to explore this remarkable passage with me, not to argue but to lovingly consider what it may reveal about when the Messiah was expected.

### Daniel’s Prayer and Gabriel’s Answer

The context of Daniel 9 is beautiful: Daniel, exiled in Babylon, prays earnestly for Israel's forgiveness and restoration after reading Jeremiah's prophecy of seventy years of exile. God responds by sending the angel Gabriel with a message even greater than Daniel expected. Instead of simply addressing the seventy years of captivity, Gabriel unveils a prophetic vision spanning seventy "weeks."

### What Are the Seventy Weeks?

Gabriel tells Daniel: “Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city” (Daniel 9:24). In Hebrew, the term "weeks" (*shavuim*) simply means "sevens." Most scholars, Jewish and Christian, understand this to mean seventy sets of seven years—a total of 490 years.

This period would bring about six divine purposes: to finish transgression, to make an end of sin, to atone for iniquity, to bring everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy. These are profound promises that point to a full and final redemption—something that sounds very much like the work of the Messiah.

### The Countdown to the Messiah

In Daniel 9:25, Gabriel gives Daniel a starting point: "From the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks." That totals 69 weeks, or 483 years, from the decree until the arrival of the Messiah.

But which decree? There were several Persian decrees related to Jerusalem:

* Cyrus' decree (538 BCE)
* Artaxerxes’ decree to Ezra (457 BCE)
* Artaxerxes’ decree to Nehemiah (445/444 BCE)

Many Christian scholars focus on Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (445 BCE), when Nehemiah was given permission to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls. Counting 483 years from 445 BCE brings us remarkably close to 30-33 CE—the exact timeframe when Yeshua of Nazareth ministered, was crucified, and rose from the dead.

Other scholars, using Ezra’s earlier decree of 457 BCE, arrive at 27 CE—when Yeshua began His public ministry after His baptism. Both calculations point squarely to the early first century, before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.

### The Cutting Off of the Anointed One

Daniel 9:26 continues: "After the sixty-two weeks, the Anointed One will be cut off and have nothing." The Hebrew word for "cut off" (*yikkaret*) often implies a violent or judicial death. Christians see here a clear reference to Yeshua’s crucifixion—a death He willingly accepted, not for His own sin, but to make atonement for others.

Following this, Daniel speaks of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple: "The people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary." This was fulfilled tragically in 70 CE when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem—just as Gabriel foretold.

### The Final Week

Daniel 9:27 describes a final "week" (seven years), during which a covenant is confirmed, but sacrifice is ended midway through. Some Christians see this as referring to Yeshua’s ministry, where He inaugurated the New Covenant and rendered the Temple sacrifices obsolete by offering Himself as the perfect and final sacrifice. Others believe this final week may point to future events still awaiting fulfillment.

### Jewish Interpretations

Many of our Jewish sages have offered different understandings of this passage. Rashi, for example, identifies the "anointed one" as Cyrus or later rulers, not a future Messiah. Others have applied it to figures like Agrippa or Antiochus. Traditional Jewish interpretations generally do not apply Daniel 9 directly to the Messiah as a personal redeemer but instead read it as referring to political events surrounding the Second Temple period.

### Could Daniel 9 Be Pointing to Yeshua?

Dear friend, could it be that Daniel 9 provides one of the clearest prophetic timetables in the Tanakh, pointing directly to the first-century arrival of Yeshua as the Messiah? The timeline remarkably aligns with His ministry, death, and the subsequent destruction of the Temple.

If Daniel’s prophecy was fulfilled in Yeshua, it would mean that the Messiah has already come—not to establish His visible kingdom immediately, but first to deal with sin, as Daniel 9:24 promises. The full peace and redemption we still long for will be completed at His return.

### A Loving Invitation

I share this not to argue, but to invite you to consider these words of Scripture with fresh eyes. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is faithful. Could it be that Yeshua is indeed the long-awaited Messiah, fulfilling both the suffering servant role (Isaiah 53) and soon, the glorious King we await (Isaiah 11, Micah 4)?

As Zechariah 12:10 foretells, a day will come when "they will look on Me whom they have pierced and mourn." But that mourning will lead to healing, redemption, and joy.

May the LORD open all our hearts to see the beauty of His promises. The Messiah’s timing was foretold. The invitation remains open.

With love and deep respect,

A fellow seeker of Israel's Messiah.
