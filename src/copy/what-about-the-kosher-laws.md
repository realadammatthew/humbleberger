_"I know and am persuaded in the Lord Yeshua that nothing is unclean in itself. Still, to someone who considers a thing to be unclean, to that one it is unclean."_

## Dear Friend, Yeshua Offers Freedom in Faith!

Beloved, the question “Do Jewish-Christians keep kosher?” touches the heart of how faith in Yeshua, the Messiah, intersects with Jewish identity and the Torah’s laws. Jewish-Christians, often called Messianic Jews, navigate their heritage and faith in unique ways. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua fulfilled the Torah, freeing believers from the obligation to keep kosher while honoring those who choose to for cultural or spiritual reasons**. Let us explore this question together, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Role of Kashrut

The Hebrew Scriptures outline the dietary laws of kashrut, guiding Israel’s covenant life:

- **Leviticus 11:1-7**: God specifies clean animals (e.g., those with split hooves and chewing the cud, like sheep) and unclean ones (e.g., pork), setting Israel apart.
- **Deuteronomy 14:3-21**: Reinforces which animals, fish, and birds are permissible, emphasizing holiness through dietary obedience.
- **Leviticus 17:10-14**: Forbids consuming blood, as “the life of the flesh is in the blood,” linking kashrut to atonement.
- **Deuteronomy 6:4-5**: The Shema calls Israel to love God wholly, with kashrut as a practical expression of devotion.

These laws, part of the 613 mitzvot enumerated by Maimonides, distinguished Israel, but many, like ritual slaughter (shechita), are challenging today without a Temple (Chabad.org).

## Yeshua: The Fulfillment of the Torah’s Dietary Laws

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Messiah who fulfills the Torah, including its dietary laws:

- **Fulfilling the Law**: “I have not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). Yeshua’s life and sacrifice complete the Torah’s purpose (GotQuestions.org).
- **Freedom in Faith**: “Nothing is unclean in itself” (Romans 14:14). Peter’s vision in Acts 10:9-16, where God declares all foods clean, suggests dietary laws are not binding for believers.
- **Atonement Through His Blood**: “The blood of Yeshua His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7), fulfilling Leviticus 17:11’s atonement requirement, making ritual blood laws obsolete.
- **Moral Focus**: Yeshua summarizes the Torah: “Love the Lord your God… and your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-40). This fulfills the heart of kashrut’s call to holiness.

Messianic Jews (175,000 in the U.S., up to 1.7 million globally) vary in practice. Some keep kosher to honor their Jewish heritage or reach traditional Jews, while others, citing New Testament freedom, do not (Jews for Jesus; Netivyah).

## The Jewish Perspective: Kashrut as Covenant Identity

With love, we acknowledge the Jewish perspective, where kashrut is central to covenant life. Mainstream Judaism—Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform—views dietary laws as divine commands to maintain holiness and Jewish identity (My Jewish Learning). Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 outline permissible foods, while rabbinic traditions, like separating meat and dairy, enhance observance (Chabad.org). Even Reform Jews, who may observe kashrut less strictly, see it as a cultural marker. Mainstream Judaism rejects Messianic Judaism as non-Jewish due to its belief in Yeshua’s divinity, viewing their kosher practices as an imitation rather than authentic (ABC News).

Messianic Jews who keep kosher often do so partially, avoiding pork or shellfish (Leviticus 11:7-12) but not always rabbinic rules, due to practical challenges or theological freedom (Reddit). The Tanakh’s promise of a new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-33) and atonement through a Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) points to Yeshua, who fulfills kashrut’s deeper purpose of holiness.

## What Happens When You Trust Yeshua?

When you trust Yeshua as the Messiah, you are freed to live in God’s love, with kashrut as a choice, not an obligation:

- **Forgiveness of Sins**: “The blood of Yeshua His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). Yeshua’s sacrifice fulfills Leviticus 17:11, replacing ritual dietary laws.
- **Covenant Heir**: “If you belong to Messiah, you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). Your faith aligns you with God’s covenant.
- **Spiritual Holiness**: The Holy Spirit empowers you to live holy lives (Hebrews 8:10), fulfilling kashrut’s call to be set apart through love and righteousness (Matthew 22:37-40).
- **Freedom in Choice**: “Let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink” (Colossians 2:16). You may keep kosher to honor your heritage, as some Messianic Jews do, but it’s not required.

Whether you choose to avoid pork or observe Shabbat, your faith in Yeshua produces good works as fruit of a transformed heart (James 2:17).

## The Call: Trust Yeshua as the Torah’s Fulfillment

Beloved, Jewish-Christians do not need to keep kosher, for Yeshua fulfilled the Torah’s dietary laws, offering freedom through faith. Some choose to observe kashrut to honor their Jewish roots, but this is a personal decision, not a requirement. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Leviticus 11**, **Deuteronomy 14**, **Isaiah 53**, **Jeremiah 31**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your heritage, whether Jewish or Gentile, aligning you with God’s promises. His love and the Holy Spirit’s guidance will sustain you, whatever your dietary choices.

## A Prayer to Trust Yeshua

Dear friend, if you seek freedom in faith and God’s grace, pray this prayer from your heart:

**Heavenly Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I confess my sins and seek Your redemption. I believe Yeshua is the Messiah, who fulfilled Your Torah through His life, death, and resurrection. I trust in His sacrifice for my salvation. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, guide me in holiness and love, and strengthen my faith. Thank You for Your love and grace. In Yeshua’s name, Amen.**

## Final Word: Yeshua, The Fulfillment of God’s Law

Yeshua is the promised Messiah who completes the Torah’s purpose. **John 1:29** declares, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah 12:10 foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you are forever free in God’s love, a true heir of His promises!**
