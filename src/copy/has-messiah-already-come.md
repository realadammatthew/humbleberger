# Has the Messiah Already Come?

## Let's review together and find out!

Dear brothers and sisters,

As a Jewish follower of Yeshua, I write this not to argue, but to lovingly explore one of the most significant questions in history: Has the Messiah already come?

For centuries, our people have prayed for the Messiah's arrival. The Hebrew Scriptures (Tanakh) provide rich and sometimes mysterious portraits of this Anointed One—some describing a victorious king, others describing a suffering servant. Could both refer to the same Messiah who comes in two stages?

### The Suffering Messiah in Isaiah 53

Isaiah 53 speaks of a servant who is despised, pierced, and killed for the sins of others, yet lives again. Traditionally, many Jewish interpretations see this servant as Israel itself. Yet ancient Jewish writings, including some from the Talmud (Sukkah 52a), interpret this passage as referring to the Messiah who would suffer and die.

Yeshua's crucifixion fits Isaiah's vision remarkably: He was rejected, pierced, died among transgressors, buried in a rich man's tomb, and resurrected—prolonging His days as Isaiah foretells. Rather than being foreign to Judaism, the idea of a suffering Messiah has deep roots within our tradition.

### Psalm 22: A Righteous Sufferer

Psalm 22 describes a righteous sufferer mocked, surrounded by enemies, pierced in hands and feet, and having his garments divided by casting lots—specific details fulfilled in Yeshua's crucifixion. While some interpret this as David's personal lament, its striking parallels to Yeshua's death cannot be ignored.

### Zechariah 12:10: Pierced and Mourned

Zechariah 12:10 declares, "They will look on Me whom they have pierced." The Talmud applies this to Messiah ben Joseph, a suffering messiah figure. Christians believe this prophecy foreshadows Yeshua's crucifixion and the future national repentance of Israel when they recognize Him as their Messiah.

### Micah 5:2 and Genesis 49:10: Born in Bethlehem, From Judah

Micah 5:2 foretells that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem—fulfilled by Yeshua's birth there. Genesis 49:10 indicates the Messiah must come before Judah loses its scepter. Since the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE and genealogies lost, if Messiah hasn't already come, how could these prophecies still be fulfilled?

### Isaiah 9:6–7 and Daniel 7: The Divine King

Isaiah 9 describes a Davidic King called "Mighty God" and "Prince of Peace." Daniel 7 envisions the Son of Man receiving everlasting dominion. Yeshua uniquely claimed these identities, referring to Himself as the Son of Man who will come with the clouds of heaven. His resurrection and ascension initiated this kingdom spiritually; His return will complete it physically.

### Daniel 9:24–27: The Prophetic Timetable

Daniel 9 predicts that Messiah would come, be "cut off," and the Temple destroyed afterward. This places Messiah's arrival before 70 CE—precisely when Yeshua lived, died, and rose. No other candidate fulfills this timeline so precisely.

### But What About the Unfulfilled Prophecies?

Many Jewish objections focus on the lack of world peace and Temple restoration. Christians believe Messiah's mission has two phases: first, to atone for sin (Isaiah 53), and second, to reign in peace (Isaiah 2, Micah 4). The kingdom is already inaugurated spiritually through Yeshua's atoning work and will be consummated at His return.

### A Loving Invitation

Dear friend, could it be that the Messiah has already come, fulfilling the suffering prophecies, and that His second coming will bring the peace we still await? The prophets spoke of both suffering and glory. Yeshua fulfills both roles: the Lamb of God who takes away sin and the King who will reign eternally.

I invite you to read these prophecies anew. Ask the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His truth. Many Jewish people, like myself, have found Yeshua to be the fulfillment of our ancient hope.

As Zechariah 12:10 promises, one day all Israel will look upon the One they pierced and mourn—and find healing. Until then, the invitation remains open: _Come, see if He is the One._

With love and deep respect,

A fellow seeker of Israel's Messiah.
