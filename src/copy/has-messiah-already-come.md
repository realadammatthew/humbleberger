_"Then I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on the house of David and the residents of Jerusalem, and they will look at me whom they pierced. They will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child and weep bitterly for him as one weeps for a firstborn."_
**(Zechariah 12:10)**

## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is the Messiah!

Beloved, as Jewish people yearning for the Messiah, you carry the sacred hope of God’s promises in the Tanakh. With love and certainty, I proclaim: **Yeshua of Nazareth is that Messiah**! He has come, fulfilling the prophecies of a suffering servant and initiating God’s kingdom, and He will return to complete His reign. Let us explore this truth together, trusting the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His Anointed One.

## The Suffering Messiah: Fulfilled in Yeshua

The Tanakh paints a vivid portrait of a Messiah who suffers for our sins:

- **Isaiah 53**: The Suffering Servant is “pierced for our transgressions,” dies, yet “prolongs His days.” Yeshua’s crucifixion, burial in a rich man’s tomb, and resurrection perfectly fulfill this. Ancient Jewish texts, like Talmud Sukkah 52a, link this to a suffering Messiah.
- **Psalm 22**: A righteous sufferer, mocked, pierced in hands and feet, with garments divided by lots, mirrors Yeshua’s crucifixion (Matthew 27:35).
- **Zechariah 12:10**: “They will look on Me whom they have pierced.” The Talmud ties this to a suffering Messiah. Yeshua’s death and Israel’s future repentance fulfill this prophecy.

Yeshua’s suffering is no contradiction but the heart of God’s redemptive plan, rooted in Jewish tradition.

## The Prophetic Timeline: Messiah Before 70 CE

The Tanakh sets a clear timetable for Messiah’s arrival:

- **Micah 5:2**: Messiah is born in Bethlehem, as Yeshua was (Matthew 2:1).
- **Genesis 49:10**: The scepter departs from Judah before Messiah comes. Judah’s autonomy ended by 70 CE, pointing to Yeshua’s time.
- **Daniel 9:24-27**: Messiah is “cut off” before the Temple’s destruction in 70 CE. Yeshua’s death around 30 CE fits this precisely.

No other figure aligns with this timeline, confirming Yeshua as the promised Messiah.

## The Divine King: Yeshua’s Reign Begun

The Tanakh also foretells a divine, reigning Messiah:

- **Isaiah 9:6-7**: A Davidic child called “Mighty God” and “Prince of Peace.” Yeshua claimed this identity (John 10:30).
- **Daniel 7:13-14**: The “Son of Man” receives eternal dominion. Yeshua, calling Himself Son of Man, ascended to reign (Acts 1:9).

Yeshua’s resurrection and ascension launched His spiritual kingdom, to be completed at His return (Isaiah 11).

## Addressing Objections with Truth

We honor your questions and answer with Scripture and love:

- **“Where’s the world peace?”** The Tanakh shows a suffering Messiah (Isaiah 53) and a reigning King (Isaiah 2). Yeshua fulfilled the first; His second coming will bring the second.
- **“Why didn’t all Jews believe?”** Thousands of Jews followed Yeshua (Acts 2:41). Romans 11:25-26 explains Israel’s partial hardening, yet promises all Israel’s salvation (Zechariah 12:10).
- **“A divine Messiah?”** Isaiah 9:6 calls Him “Mighty God”; Daniel 7 shows Him worshipped. Yeshua’s divinity fulfills these prophecies.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua, the Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua has come, fulfilling Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Daniel 9, and more. No one else matches the Tanakh’s portrait. He died for your sins, rose, and reigns, offering eternal life. We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Psalm 22**, **Zechariah 12**, **Daniel 9**—and ask God to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant.

## Final Word: The Messiah Has Come!

Yeshua, the Suffering Servant and Divine King, is Israel’s Messiah and the world’s Savior. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, He calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives!**
