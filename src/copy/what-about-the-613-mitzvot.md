## Dear Friend, Yeshua Completes the Torah’s Purpose!

Beloved, the question “Do I need to follow all 613 mitzvot?” touches the heart of G-d’s covenant with His people and His plan of salvation. The 613 mitzvot, central to Jewish life, raise questions for those who encounter Yeshua, the Messiah. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua fulfilled the Torah, freeing us from the obligation of all 613 mitzvot while calling us to live out its moral heart through faith in Him**. Let us explore this truth together, resting in the warmth of G-d’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Torah’s Role

The Hebrew Scriptures reveal the Torah’s purpose, given to guide Israel in righteousness:

- **Exodus 20:1-17**: The Ten Commandments, including “You shall not murder” and “Honor your father and mother,” establish G-d’s moral standards.
- **Leviticus 17:11**: “The life of the flesh is in the blood… it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.” The sacrificial laws point to atonement for sin.
- **Deuteronomy 6:4-5**: “Hear, O Israel: The L-RD our G-d, the L-RD is one. You shall love the L-RD your G-d with all your heart.” The Shema calls for devotion to G-d.
- **Jeremiah 31:31-33**: “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel… I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.” A new covenant is promised.

The 613 mitzvot—248 positive and 365 negative, as enumerated by Maimonides—guided Israel, but many, like Temple sacrifices (Leviticus 12:6), cannot be observed today without a Temple (Chabad.org).

## Yeshua: The Fulfillment of the Torah

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Messiah who fulfills the Torah’s purpose:

- **Fulfilling the Law**: “I have not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). Yeshua’s life and sacrifice complete the Torah’s requirements (GotQuestions.org).
- **Atonement Through His Blood**: “The blood of Yeshua His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7), fulfilling Leviticus 17:11’s need for atonement.
- **New Covenant Mediator**: “This cup is the new covenant in My blood” (Luke 22:20), fulfilling Jeremiah 31:31-34 by writing G-d’s law on our hearts through faith.
- **Freedom from the Law’s Burden**: “You are not under the law, but under grace” (Romans 6:14). Salvation comes through faith in Yeshua, not works of the Law (Ephesians 2:8-9).

Yeshua, a Jew who observed Torah, taught the heart of the Law: “Love the L-RD your G-d… and your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:37-40). This fulfills the moral essence of the mitzvot, freeing believers from the 613’s full obligations.

## The Modern Jewish Perspective: The Centrality of the Mitzvot

With love, we acknowledge the modern Jewish perspective, where the 613 mitzvot are central to covenant life. Maimonides’ *Mishneh Torah* enumerates these commandments as G-d’s will for Israel, guiding ethical, ritual, and communal life (Jewish Virtual Library). Many mitzvot, like those for Temple sacrifices or tithing cattle (Leviticus 27:32), are currently unobservable without a Temple, yet Jews uphold applicable mitzvot like Shabbat, kosher laws, and tzedakah (charity) as expressions of devotion (Chabad.org). Mainstream Judaism—Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform—rejects the idea that a Messiah could nullify the Torah’s commands, viewing them as eternal (Deuteronomy 29:29).

Messianic Jews (175,000 in the U.S., up to 1.7 million globally) may observe some mitzvot, like Shabbat or Passover, to honor their heritage, but they believe Yeshua’s sacrifice fulfills the sacrificial laws, making full observance optional (119ministries.com). Mainstream Judaism, however, does not recognize Messianic Judaism as Jewish due to its acceptance of Yeshua’s divinity (My Jewish Learning).

The Tanakh’s promise of a new covenant (Jeremiah 31) and atonement through a Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) points to Yeshua, who fulfills the Torah’s purpose while preserving its moral heart.

## What Happens When You Trust Yeshua?

When you trust Yeshua as the Messiah, you are freed to live in G-d’s love:

- **Forgiveness of Sins**: “The blood of Yeshua His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). Yeshua’s sacrifice fulfills the Torah’s atonement (Leviticus 17:11).
- **Heir of the Covenant**: “If you belong to Messiah, you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). You remain part of G-d’s plan for Israel.
- **Transformed Heart**: The Holy Spirit writes G-d’s law on your heart (Hebrews 8:10), empowering you to live out love and righteousness (Matthew 22:37-40).
- **Freedom in Faith**: “It is for freedom that Messiah has set us free” (Galatians 5:1). You are not bound by the 613 mitzvot but live by faith, producing good works (James 2:17).

You may choose to observe mitzvot like Shabbat or Passover to connect with your heritage, as some Messianic Jews do, but this is a personal choice, not a requirement for salvation.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua as the Torah’s Fulfillment

Beloved, you do not need to follow all 613 mitzvot, for Yeshua has fulfilled the Torah, offering salvation through faith. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is L-RD and believe in your heart that G-d raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Exodus 20**, **Leviticus 17**, **Isaiah 53**, **Jeremiah 31**—and ask the G-d of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your heritage, whether Jewish or Gentile, aligning you with G-d’s covenant. His love and the Holy Spirit’s guidance will sustain you, even amidst differing views.

## A Prayer to Trust Yeshua

Dear friend, if you seek freedom from the Law’s burden and desire G-d’s grace, pray this prayer from your heart:

**Heavenly Father, G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I confess my sins and seek Your redemption. I believe Yeshua is the Messiah, who fulfilled Your Torah through His life, death, and resurrection. I trust in His sacrifice for my salvation. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, guide me in love and righteousness, and strengthen my faith. Thank You for Your love and grace. In Yeshua’s name, Amen.**

## Final Word: Yeshua, The Fulfillment of G-d’s Law

Yeshua is the promised Messiah who completes the Torah’s purpose. **John 1:29** declares, “Behold, the Lamb of G-d, who takes away the sin of the world!” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah 12:10 foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you are forever free in G-d’s love, a true heir of His promises!**
