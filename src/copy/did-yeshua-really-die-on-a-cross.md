## Dear Friend, Yeshua’s Cross Is Our Salvation

Beloved, the claim that Yeshua of Nazareth was crucified as the Messiah may challenge Jewish expectations, but it is the heart of God’s redemptive plan. With love and certainty, we proclaim: **Yeshua, crucified and risen, is Israel’s Messiah**! His death on the cross fulfills the Tanakh’s prophecies, atones for our sins, and offers eternal life to all who trust Him. Let’s explore this truth together, trusting the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His Messiah.

## The Historical Evidence: Undeniable Truth

Yeshua’s crucifixion is a historical fact, affirmed by diverse sources. The four Gospels record His public execution under Pontius Pilate. Non-Christian witnesses confirm this:

- **Tacitus** (Roman historian, c. 116 CE) wrote that “Christus” suffered “the extreme penalty” under Pilate.
- **Josephus** (Jewish historian, c. 93 CE) noted Yeshua was “condemned to be crucified and to die.”
- **Babylonian Talmud** references “Yeshu the Nazarene” being “hanged” on Passover eve, a term for crucifixion.
- **Lucian** (pagan writer) mocked Christians for worshiping a “crucified sage.”

Historians—Jewish, Christian, secular—agree: Yeshua was crucified. As Jewish scholar Jodi Magness states, “The Romans were very efficient. When they meant to kill you by crucifixion, they did.”

## Why a Crucified Messiah?

Some ask, “How could the Messiah die on a cross, cursed under the Torah?” (Deuteronomy 21:23). This is no contradiction but the fulfillment of prophecy. The apostle Paul, a Torah-trained Jew, declares:

> “Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.” _(Galatians 3:13)_

Yeshua took our curse upon Himself. The Tanakh foretold this:

- **Isaiah 53:5-6**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.”
- **Psalm 22:16**: “They pierced my hands and feet.”
- **Zechariah 12:10**: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.”

Far from disqualifying Him, Yeshua’s crucifixion marks Him as the Suffering Servant who bears our sins.

## The Cross: The Ultimate Sacrifice

The Torah teaches that sin demands atonement through sacrifice (Leviticus 17:11). The Passover lamb’s blood saved Israel from death (Exodus 12). Yeshua, proclaimed by John the Baptist as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29), fulfills this. His crucifixion, timed with Passover, is the perfect sacrifice—satisfying God’s justice and extending His mercy to all who believe.

## The Resurrection: God’s Triumph

The cross is inseparable from the resurrection. Three days after His death, God raised Yeshua, proving His sacrifice was accepted and His claims true. Isaiah 53:10-11 foretells the Servant living after suffering. Over 500 witnesses saw the risen Yeshua (1 Corinthians 15:6), and His Jewish disciples, transformed from fear to boldness, died proclaiming this truth.

## The Call: Trust the Crucified Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua’s crucifixion is no failure—it’s God’s plan to redeem you. He bore your sins on the cross, fulfilling the Tanakh’s promises. No one else matches the prophecies of Isaiah, Psalm 22, or Zechariah. He alone is the Messiah who died and rose to save us.

We lovingly urge you: Repent and trust Yeshua today. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Psalm 22**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask God to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant.

## Final Word: Yeshua, Our Passover Lamb

Yeshua, crucified and risen, is the Messiah who fulfills God’s promises to Israel and the world. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, Yeshua calls: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” (Revelation 3:20).

Beloved, will you trust Yeshua, the Lamb of God, today?
