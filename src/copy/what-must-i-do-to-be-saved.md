## Dear Friend, Salvation Is Found in Yeshua Alone!

Beloved, the question “What must I do to be saved?” echoes through the ages, stirring the heart of every soul seeking peace with God. The Tanakh and the New Covenant proclaim one clear answer: **Salvation comes through faith in Yeshua, the Messiah, who died for our sins and rose again**. His finished work fulfills God’s promises, offering eternal life to all who trust Him. With unwavering confidence and tender love, we invite you to embrace this truth, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Promise: A Savior for Sinners

The Hebrew Scriptures reveal humanity’s need for salvation and God’s provision through a Messiah:

- **Isaiah 53:5-6**: “He was pierced for our transgressions… the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” The Suffering Servant bears our sins to restore us to God.
- **Psalm 49:7-8, 15**: No human can redeem another, but “God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol.”
- **Zechariah 12:10**: Israel will “look on Me, the One they have pierced,” receiving grace through the Messiah’s sacrifice.

The Torah’s sacrifices, like those on Yom Kippur, were shadows pointing to a greater atonement (Leviticus 17:11). They could not fully cleanse (Hebrews 10:1-4), but they foretold a Savior who would.

## Yeshua: The Way of Salvation

Dear friend, Yeshua is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan. The New Covenant declares:

- **The Atoning Sacrifice**: “Messiah died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3). His death satisfies God’s justice, paying the penalty for sin (Romans 3:25).
- **The Risen Lord**: “He was raised on the third day” (1 Corinthians 15:4), proving His victory over death and securing our justification (Romans 4:25).
- **The Only Mediator**: “There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).

To be saved, you need only trust in Yeshua. **Ephesians 2:8-9** declares, “By grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works.” Faith in Yeshua’s finished work—His death and resurrection—brings forgiveness, righteousness, and adoption as God’s child (Galatians 4:4-5).

## The Jewish Perspective: A Covenant of Works

With love, we acknowledge our Jewish brethren’s view of salvation through covenant faithfulness. Rabbinic tradition teaches that keeping the mitzvot (commandments), teshuvah (repentance), tefillah (prayer), and tzedakah (charity) align one with God’s will. Maimonides emphasized teshuvah as central, citing Malachi 3:7, “Return to Me, and I will return to you.” Yom Kippur’s liturgy and ethical living reflect this, with hope in a future messianic redemption and resurrection (Daniel 12:2).

Yet, the Tanakh reveals human efforts fall short: “All our righteousnesses are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). The repeated Temple sacrifices could not perfect (Hebrews 10:1), pointing to a divine Savior. Yeshua fulfills this need, offering salvation not by works but by grace through faith (Galatians 2:16).

## What Must You Do?

The New Covenant answers clearly: **Repent and believe in Yeshua**. 

- **Repent**: Turn from sin, acknowledging your need for God’s mercy (Acts 3:19). Repentance is a gift from God, enabled by His Spirit (2 Timothy 2:25).
- **Believe**: Trust that Yeshua’s death paid for your sins and His resurrection guarantees your life (John 3:16). Confess Him as Lord, believing God raised Him (Romans 10:9).
- **Receive Grace**: Salvation is God’s gift, not earned by mitzvot, charity, or prayer (Ephesians 2:8). Yeshua’s righteousness is imputed to you, making you right with God.

Good works—obedience, charity, and holy living—flow from salvation, not to earn it. As James 2:17 says, “Faith without works is dead,” but these works are the fruit of a saved life, not its root.

## Why Yeshua’s Salvation Matters

Yeshua’s work transforms everything:

- **Justification**: You are declared righteous by faith in Yeshua, not by works (Romans 3:28).
- **Adoption**: You become God’s child, crying “Abba, Father!” by the Spirit (Romans 8:15).
- **Eternal Life**: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life” (John 3:36). Yeshua guarantees your resurrection (John 11:25).
- **Unshakable Security**: “No one will snatch them out of My hand” (John 10:28). Those who trust Yeshua are kept by God’s power.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua Today

Beloved, salvation is not found in human effort but in Yeshua’s finished work. He is the Suffering Servant, the Lamb of God, the Risen King. With tender urgency, we call you to trust Him. **Acts 16:31** promises, “Believe in the Lord Yeshua, and you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Psalm 49**, **Zechariah 12**, **Daniel 12**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who completes God’s covenant. His sacrifice, not our works, saves perfectly.

## Final Word: Yeshua, Our Eternal Savior

Yeshua is the only way to salvation, fulfilling God’s plan from the Tanakh to the New Covenant. **John 14:6** declares, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” He lives, interceding for us (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, we are saved forever!**
