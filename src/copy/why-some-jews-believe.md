## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is Israel’s Promised Messiah!

Beloved, the question “Why do some Jewish people believe in Yeshua today?” opens a door to the heart of G-d’s redemptive plan for Israel and the world. While mainstream Judaism awaits a Messiah, some Jews—known as Messianic Jews—have found in Yeshua the fulfillment of the Tanakh’s promises. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua, the Messiah, fulfills the Torah and prophets, offering salvation while embracing Jewish identity**. Let us explore why some Jewish people embrace Him today, resting in the warmth of G-d’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Testimony: A Messiah Foretold

The Hebrew Scriptures proclaim a coming Messiah who brings redemption to Israel:

- **Isaiah 53:4-6**: “He has borne our griefs… He was pierced for our transgressions… the L-RD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.” The Suffering Servant atones for sin.
- **Micah 5:2**: A ruler from Bethlehem, “whose coming forth is from of old,” will lead G-d’s people.
- **Psalm 16:10**: “You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let Your holy one see corruption,” hinting at resurrection.
- **Jeremiah 31:31-33**: “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel… I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.”

These prophecies point to a Messiah who suffers, dies, rises, and establishes a new covenant. For Messianic Jews, Yeshua fulfills these promises, confirming His identity as Israel’s Savior.

## Yeshua: The Jewish Messiah of the New Covenant

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Messiah who fulfills the Tanakh’s hope:

- **Prophetic Fulfillment**: Born in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:1-6), Yeshua suffered for humanity’s sins (1 Peter 2:24) and rose from the dead (Matthew 28:1-10), fulfilling Isaiah 53, Psalm 16, and Micah 5.
- **New Covenant Mediator**: “This cup is the new covenant in My blood” (Luke 22:20), fulfilling Jeremiah 31:31-34 by offering forgiveness through His sacrifice.
- **Salvation by Faith**: “Whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). Yeshua’s atonement brings Jews and Gentiles to G-d (Romans 3:29-30).
- **Jewish Roots**: Yeshua, a Jew, lived according to Torah, observing Passover and teaching in Synagogues (Luke 4:16, 22:15). His first followers were Jews who remained faithful to their heritage (Acts 2:46, 21:20).

Messianic Jews, numbering 175,000 in the U.S. and up to 1.7 million worldwide, believe Yeshua enhances their Jewishness, blending Torah observance with faith in Him as the Messiah.

## The Modern Jewish Perspective: Why Many Do Not Believe

With love, we acknowledge our Jewish brethren’s perspective. Mainstream Judaism—Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform—rejects Yeshua as the Messiah for several reasons:

- **Unfulfilled Prophecies**: The Messiah is expected to rebuild the Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28), gather all Jews to Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6), and establish world peace (Isaiah 2:4). Since these await fulfillment, many Jews continue to await the Messiah (Aish.com, 2009).
- **Theological Concerns**: Yeshua’s divinity and the Trinity are misunderstood to conflict with modern Jewish monotheism—although this is not true, as The Shema is actually a call of exclusivity to the G-d of Israel and the Triune G-d is three-in-one as opposed to tritheism or the worship of three G-ds. Maimonides’ principles require a human Messiah who upholds Torah, while Yeshua’s teachings, like Sabbath healings (John 9:14), are seen as violations (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 11:4).
- **Historical Tensions**: Centuries of Christian anti-Semitism, from Crusades to pogroms, have created resistance to Yeshua, with groups like Jews for Jesus viewed as proselytizing (My Jewish Learning, 2016).

Yet, the Tanakh’s Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) and new covenant promise (Jeremiah 31) align with Yeshua’s first coming, with His return to fulfill remaining prophecies. Psalm 49:7-8, 15 declares, “No one can ransom another… but G-d will redeem my soul,” pointing to Yeshua’s atoning sacrifice.

## Why Some Jews Believe in Yeshua Today

Some Jewish people embrace Yeshua for compelling reasons:

- **Scriptural Conviction**: They see Yeshua fulfilling Isaiah 53’s Suffering Servant, Micah 5’s Bethlehem-born ruler, and Psalm 16’s resurrection promise, believing He will complete prophecies like world peace at His return.
- **Jewish Identity Enhanced**: Messianic Jews observe Shabbat, Passover, and other traditions, seeing Yeshua as the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7) and the fulfillment of Jewish hopes, not a rejection of them.
- **Personal Encounters**: Many come to faith through personal experiences, often during the 1960s “Jesus people” movement, finding Yeshua as the culmination of their Jewish faith (Jews for Jesus, 2021).
- **Historical Continuity**: They view their faith as a continuation of first-century Jewish believers like Peter and Paul, who remained Jewish while following Yeshua (Acts 21:20).

Though mainstream Judaism views this as incompatible, Messianic Jews find in Yeshua a deeper connection to their heritage.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua as Israel’s Messiah

Beloved, some Jewish people believe in Yeshua because He fulfills the Tanakh’s promises, offering salvation while honoring their Jewish identity. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is L-RD and believe in your heart that G-d raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Micah 5**, **Psalm 16**, **Jeremiah 31**—and ask the G-d of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua does not forsake your Jewishness but fulfills it, making you an heir of Abraham’s promise (Galatians 3:29). Despite challenges from family or community, Yeshua’s love will guide you.

## A Prayer to Trust Yeshua

Dear friend, if you feel drawn to Yeshua as Israel’s Messiah, pray this prayer from your heart:

**Heavenly Father, G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I confess my sins and seek Your redemption. I believe Yeshua is the Messiah, who died for my sins and rose again, fulfilling Your Torah and prophets. I trust in His sacrifice for my salvation. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, deepen my Jewish identity, and guide me in Your truth. Thank You for Your love and grace. In Yeshua’s name, Amen.**

## Final Word: Yeshua, The Hope of Israel

Yeshua is the promised Messiah who completes G-d’s covenant with Israel. **John 1:29** declares, “Behold, the Lamb of G-d, who takes away the sin of the world!” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah 12:10 foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you are forever G-d’s child, a true heir of Israel!**
