## Dear Friend, Yeshua Reveals the Truth About Hell!

Beloved, the question “Does hell exist?” touches the heart of our eternal destiny, stirring both fear and hope. The Tanakh and New Covenant reveal a sobering reality: hell, or eternal separation from God, awaits those who reject His mercy, but God’s love shines brighter through Yeshua, the Messiah. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua’s death and resurrection offer the only way to escape judgment and enter God’s eternal presence**. Let us explore this truth together, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Testimony: Shadows of Judgment

The Hebrew Scriptures provide glimpses of a place of judgment, though often veiled:

- **Psalm 6:5**: “For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who can give You praise?” Sheol is a shadowy underworld where all go, hinting at separation from God’s presence.
- **Daniel 12:2**: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt.” This suggests a future judgment with consequences for the unrighteous.
- **Isaiah 66:24**: “Their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched.” This imagery points to a place of enduring punishment for the wicked.

While the Tanakh focuses on this life, these passages foreshadow a reality of divine justice for those who reject God, setting the stage for clearer New Covenant teachings.

## Yeshua: The Truth About Hell and Salvation

Dear friend, Yeshua’s teachings in the New Covenant clarify the reality of hell and God’s merciful solution:

- **Eternal Punishment**: “Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41). Yeshua describes hell as a place of eternal, conscious punishment for those who reject God (Matthew 25:46).
- **Unquenchable Fire**: “Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched” (Mark 9:44-48). Hell is a state of unending separation from God’s presence.
- **Destruction of Soul and Body**: “Fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matthew 10:28). Hell is the ultimate consequence of unrepentant sin.
- **Salvation Through Faith**: “Whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). Yeshua’s death atones for sin, offering escape from hell through faith (Romans 5:8).

Yeshua’s resurrection proves His victory over sin and death, ensuring that those who trust Him are saved from eternal punishment and welcomed into God’s kingdom (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

## The Jewish Perspective: Gehinnom and Ethical Living

With love, we acknowledge our Jewish brethren’s view of the afterlife. Rabbinic tradition speaks of Gehinnom, not as eternal torment but as a temporary purification process, often lasting up to 12 months (Talmud, Rosh Hashanah 17a). Described as a “spiritual washing machine,” Gehinnom cleanses most souls before they enter Olam Ha-Ba, the World to Come. Only the most wicked face prolonged punishment. The Tanakh’s Sheol (Psalm 6:5) is a vague underworld, and modern Jewish thought, especially Reform and Reconstructionist, often de-emphasizes the afterlife, focusing on mitzvot (commandments) and ethical living now, as seen in Avot 4:17: “Better one hour of repentance and good deeds in this world than the whole of the life in the world to come.”

Yet, the Tanakh warns of a final judgment (Daniel 12:2), and human efforts cannot fully satisfy God’s justice: “No one can ransom another… but God will redeem my soul” (Psalm 49:7-8, 15). Yeshua fulfills this need, offering eternal life through faith, not works (Romans 3:28), completing the Tanakh’s hope.

## What Happens When You Trust Yeshua?

When you place your faith in Yeshua, the threat of hell is replaced with eternal hope:

- **Forgiveness of Sins**: “The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). Yeshua’s sacrifice atones, sparing you from judgment.
- **Eternal Life**: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life” (John 3:36). You are promised God’s presence forever.
- **Freedom from Fear**: “There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear” (1 John 4:18). Yeshua’s love secures your destiny.
- **Transformation**: The Holy Spirit produces righteousness and peace in your life (Galatians 5:22-23), preparing you for eternity with God.

Good works—mitzvot and charity—flow from this salvation, not to avoid hell, but as fruit of a transformed heart (James 2:17).

## The Call: Trust Yeshua to Escape Judgment

Beloved, hell is a real consequence of rejecting God’s mercy, but Yeshua offers the way to eternal life. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Psalm 6**, **Daniel 12**, **Isaiah 66**, **Isaiah 53**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your Jewish heritage, embracing the One who conquers sin and death. His sacrifice ensures you will not face eternal punishment but dwell with God forever.

## A Prayer to Trust Yeshua

Dear friend, if you fear judgment and long for God’s mercy, pray this prayer from your heart:

**Heavenly Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I confess my sins separate me from You. I believe Yeshua is the Messiah, who died for my sins and rose again to save me from judgment. I trust in His sacrifice alone for my salvation. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, cleanse me, and secure my place in Your presence. Thank You for Your love and grace. In Yeshua’s name, Amen.**

## Final Word: Yeshua, Our Deliverer from Judgment

Yeshua is the promised Messiah who rescues us from the penalty of sin. **John 3:36** declares, “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah 12:10 foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you are saved from judgment forever!**
