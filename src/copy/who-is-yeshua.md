## Dear Friend, Who Is Yeshua?

Beloved, the question of the Messiah is the heartbeat of God’s plan for humanity. As Jewish people, you carry the sacred calling of God’s covenant, His Torah, and His promises. The Tanakh points to a singular Anointed One, and we proclaim with joy: **Yeshua of Nazareth is that Messiah**! Far from dividing, He fulfills Israel’s story, offering salvation to all through His life, death, and resurrection. Come, let us explore this truth together, rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures and confirmed in the New Testament.

## The Messianic Hope: God’s Promise in the Tanakh

The Tanakh weaves a clear portrait of the Messiah:

- **Seed of the Woman** _(Genesis 3:15)_: He crushes the serpent’s head, defeating sin.
- **Son of Abraham** _(Genesis 12:3)_: Through Him, all nations are blessed.
- **Lion of Judah** _(Genesis 49:10)_: The scepter of rule belongs to Him.
- **Prophet Like Moses** _(Deuteronomy 18:15-19)_: He speaks God’s words with authority.
- **Son of David** _(2 Samuel 7:12-16)_: His kingdom endures forever.
- **Suffering Servant** _(Isaiah 53)_: He bears our sins, bringing healing by His wounds.
- **Righteous Branch** _(Jeremiah 23:5-6)_: He reigns with justice as King.
- **Messenger of the Covenant** _(Malachi 3:1)_: He comes to the Temple before its destruction.

These prophecies converge on one Messiah—Yeshua, who alone fulfills them all.

## Yeshua in History: The First-Century Fulfillment

In the first century, under Roman oppression, Israel longed for the Messiah. Into this world came **Yeshua of Nazareth**, a Jewish rabbi whose life, miracles, death, and resurrection are recorded in Jewish and Roman sources (Josephus, Tacitus, the Talmud) and the Gospels. He declared, “I have not come to abolish the Torah or the Prophets but to fulfill them” (**Matthew 5:17**). Yeshua is the culmination of Israel’s hope.

## The Gospels: A Jewish Testimony to Yeshua

The Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are Jewish writings that proclaim Yeshua as Messiah.

### Matthew: The King of Israel

Matthew reveals Yeshua as the promised **Son of David** and **Son of Abraham**:

- His genealogy traces to David and Abraham (**Matthew 1:1-17**).
- His virgin birth fulfills **Isaiah 7:14**: “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.”
- His miracles echo **Isaiah 35:5-6**, healing the blind and lame.
- His teachings, like the Sermon on the Mount (**Matthew 5–7**), deepen the Torah, calling us to heart obedience.

### Luke: The Savior of All

Luke shows Yeshua’s love for Israel and the nations:

- Simeon declares Him “a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to Your people Israel” (**Luke 2:32**).
- He restores outcasts—lepers, sinners, and even a Roman centurion’s servant (**Luke 7**).
- His parables, like the Prodigal Son (**Luke 15**), reveal God’s relentless grace.
- He weeps over Jerusalem’s rejection, longing to gather her (**Luke 19:41-44**).

### John: The Divine Messiah

John proclaims Yeshua’s divine identity:

- “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us” (**John 1:1-14**).
- His “I AM” statements echo God’s name in **Exodus 3:14**.
- As the **Lamb of God** (**John 1:29**), He fulfills the Passover sacrifice (**Exodus 12**).
- His death at Passover and resurrection on the third day confirm He is the Messiah (**Matthew 12:40**).

## The Cross: The Atonement Foretold

The cross is no defeat but the fulfillment of prophecy. Isaiah saw the Messiah’s suffering:

> “He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities... by His wounds we are healed.” (**Isaiah 53:5**)

**Psalm 22:16-18** describes His crucifixion: “They pierced my hands and feet... they divide my garments.” Yeshua’s death is the ultimate **Korban**, the atoning sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the Torah’s demands once for all (**Leviticus 16; Hebrews 9-10**).

---

## The Resurrection: God’s Victory

Yeshua’s resurrection, witnessed by over 500 (**1 Corinthians 15:3-8**), proves His triumph over sin and death (**Isaiah 25:8; Hosea 13:14**). It launches the **New Covenant** of **Jeremiah 31:31-34**, where God writes His law on our hearts and forgives our sins forever.

---

## The New Covenant: Israel’s Renewal

The New Covenant is God’s promise fulfilled:

> “I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts... I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” (**Jeremiah 31:31-34**)

> “I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit... I will put My Spirit within you.” (**Ezekiel 36:26-27**)

Yeshua seals this covenant, pouring out His Spirit on **Shavuot** (Pentecost, **Acts 2**), transforming hearts to follow God.

## The First Jewish Believers: Finding the Messiah

Yeshua’s earliest followers were Jewish—**Peter (Shimon)**, **James (Yaakov)**, **John (Yochanan)**, and **Paul (Shaul)**, a Pharisee. They saw Yeshua as the fulfillment of the Tanakh:

> “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Yeshua of Nazareth.” (**John 1:45**)

Believing in Yeshua was not leaving Judaism but embracing its promised hope.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua, the Messiah

Dear friend, Yeshua is the Messiah—Israel’s King, the Suffering Servant, the Prophet like Moses, and the Son of David. No one else in history matches the Tanakh’s prophecies. He alone lived perfectly, died for your sins, and rose to give you life.

We urge you: Turn to Yeshua today. Repent of sin and trust in His atoning sacrifice. As **Romans 10:9** declares, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Ask God to reveal His Messiah to you, and find the peace only Yeshua brings.

## Final Word: God’s Faithful Promise

God’s covenant with Israel endures. Yeshua is its fulfillment, ensuring God’s promises stand forever. One day, all Israel will see Him, as **Zechariah 12:10** foretells: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, His invitation is open: Come to Yeshua, the Messiah, and live.

> “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him.” (**Revelation 3:20**)

**Shalom.**
