## Before We Begin

Have you ever spoken with a _Christian_ about their faith? Maybe you know some, or maybe this is all new to you! Either way, you might have heard a little word called “_the Gospel_.” It’s a small word with a powerful message: the _Good News_ that _God loves you_ and has a plan to restore you to Him. We’re about to embark on a spiritual journey called “_Encountering Messiah_.” Curious about what _Messiah_ means? In the Hebrew Scriptures, it simply means _Anointed One_—God’s chosen Redeemer. Let’s start this journey by exploring the heart of this _Good News_!

## What is The Gospel?

In the beginning, God created a perfect world, but humanity fell into sin, breaking our relationship with Him (Genesis 1–3). Yet, God promised a Redeemer, _Yeshua the Messiah_, who was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on a cross to pay for our sins, and rose three days later, defeating Satan and proving His deity (Isaiah 53; Matthew 1:23; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4). He ascended to heaven, commissioned His followers to share this _Good News_, and will return to renew all creation, bringing a new heaven and new earth (Acts 1:11; Revelation 21:1). This is _the Gospel_—God’s plan to restore us through _Yeshua_. This promise echoes in the ancient Scriptures, and we’ll explore how it comes to life. Hop on this journey, “_Encountering Messiah_,” to meet _Yeshua_ personally. Let’s get started!

## A Word from the Scriptures

The Gospel’s promise of a Redeemer was foretold centuries ago. Let the ancient words of the prophet Isaiah guide us as we begin. Written long before _Yeshua_’s birth, they paint a vivid picture of the _Messiah_’s mission. These words may stir your heart or even challenge you, but they invite you to discover the One who fulfills God’s promises. Take a moment to let this truth settle in as we prepare to explore _Yeshua_’s story together:

> ### _"He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering who knew what sickness was. He was like someone people turned away from; he was despised, and we didn’t value him. But he was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds."_
>
> **(Isaiah 53:3,5)**

## Dear Friend, Who Is Yeshua?

Beloved, the question of the _Messiah_ is the heartbeat of God’s plan for humanity. As Jewish people, you carry the sacred calling of God’s covenant, His Torah, and His promises. The Tanakh points to a singular _Anointed One_, and we proclaim with joy: _Yeshua of Nazareth_ is that _Messiah_! Far from dividing, He fulfills Israel’s story, offering salvation to all through His life, death, and resurrection. Come, let us explore this truth together, rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures and confirmed in the New Testament.

## The Messianic Hope: God’s Promise in the Tanakh

The Tanakh weaves a clear portrait of the _Messiah_:

- **Seed of the Woman** _(Genesis 3:15)_: He crushes the serpent’s head, defeating sin.
- **Son of Abraham** _(Genesis 12:3)_: Through Him, all nations are blessed.
- **Lion of Judah** _(Genesis 49:10)_: The scepter of rule belongs to Him.
- **Prophet Like Moses** _(Deuteronomy 18:15-19)_: He speaks God’s words with authority.
- **Son of David** _(2 Samuel 7:12-16)_: His kingdom endures forever.
- **Suffering Servant** _(Isaiah 53)_: He bears our sins, bringing healing by His wounds.
- **Righteous Branch** _(Jeremiah 23:5-6)_: He reigns with justice as King.
- **Messenger of the Covenant** _(Malachi 3:1)_: He comes to the Temple before its destruction.

These prophecies converge on one _Messiah_—_Yeshua_, who alone fulfills them all.

## Yeshua in History: The First-Century Fulfillment

In the first century, under Roman oppression, Israel longed for the _Messiah_. Into this world came _Yeshua of Nazareth_, a Jewish rabbi whose life, miracles, death, and resurrection are recorded in Jewish and Roman sources (Josephus, Tacitus, the Talmud) and the Gospels. He declared, “I have not come to abolish the Torah or the Prophets but to fulfill them” (**Matthew 5:17**). _Yeshua_ is the culmination of Israel’s hope.

## The Gospels: A Jewish Testimony to Yeshua

The Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are Jewish writings that proclaim _Yeshua_ as _Messiah_.

### Matthew: The King of Israel

Matthew reveals _Yeshua_ as the promised **Son of David** and **Son of Abraham**:

- His genealogy traces to David and Abraham (**Matthew 1:1-17**).
- His virgin birth fulfills **Isaiah 7:14**: “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.”
- His miracles echo **Isaiah 35:5-6**, healing the blind and lame.
- His teachings, like the Sermon on the Mount (**Matthew 5–7**), deepen the Torah, calling us to heart obedience.

### Luke: The Savior of All

Luke shows _Yeshua_’s love for Israel and the nations:

- Simeon declares Him “a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to Your people Israel” (**Luke 2:32**).
- He restores outcasts—lepers, sinners, and even a Roman centurion’s servant (**Luke 7**).
- His parables, like the Prodigal Son (**Luke 15**), reveal God’s relentless grace.
- He weeps over Jerusalem’s rejection, longing to gather her (**Luke 19:41-44**).

### John: The Divine Messiah

John proclaims _Yeshua_’s divine identity:

- “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us” (**John 1:1-14**).
- His “I AM” statements echo God’s name in **Exodus 3:14**.
- As the **Lamb of God** (**John 1:29**), He fulfills the Passover sacrifice (**Exodus 12**).
- His death at Passover and resurrection on the third day confirm He is the _Messiah_ (**Matthew 12:40**).

## The Cross: The Atonement Foretold

The cross is no defeat but the fulfillment of prophecy. Isaiah saw the _Messiah_’s suffering:

> “He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities... by His wounds we are healed.” (**Isaiah 53:5**)

**Psalm 22:16-18** describes His crucifixion: “They pierced my hands and feet... they divide my garments.” _Yeshua_’s death is the ultimate **Korban**, the atoning sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the Torah’s demands once for all (**Leviticus 16; Hebrews 9-10**).

---

## The Resurrection: God’s Victory

_Yeshua_’s resurrection, witnessed by over 500 (**1 Corinthians 15:3-8**), proves His triumph over sin and death (**Isaiah 25:8; Hosea 13:14**). It launches the **New Covenant** of **Jeremiah 31:31-34**, where God writes His law on our hearts and forgives our sins forever.

---

## The New Covenant: Israel’s Renewal

The New Covenant is God’s promise fulfilled:

> “I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts... I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” (**Jeremiah 31:31-34**)

> “I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit... I will put My Spirit within you.” (**Ezekiel 36:26-27**)

_Yeshua_ seals this covenant, pouring out His Spirit on **Shavuot** (Pentecost, **Acts 2**), transforming hearts to follow God.

---

## The First Jewish Believers: Finding the Messiah

_Yeshua_’s earliest followers were Jewish—**Peter (Shimon)**, **James (Yaakov)**, **John (Yochanan)**, and **Paul (Shaul)**, a Pharisee. They saw _Yeshua_ as the fulfillment of the Tanakh:

> “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—_Yeshua_ of Nazareth.” (**John 1:45**)

Believing in _Yeshua_ was not leaving Judaism but embracing its promised hope.

---

## The Call: Trust Yeshua, the Messiah

Dear friend, _Yeshua_ is the Messiah—Israel’s King, the Suffering Servant, the Prophet like Moses, and the Son of David. No one else in history matches the Tanakh’s prophecies. He alone lived perfectly, died for your sins, and rose to give you life.

We urge you: Turn to _Yeshua_ today. Repent of sin and trust in His atoning sacrifice. As **Romans 10:9** declares, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Ask God to reveal His Messiah to you, and find the peace only _Yeshua_ brings.

## Final Word: God’s Faithful Promise

God’s covenant with Israel endures. _Yeshua_ is its fulfillment, ensuring God’s promises stand forever. One day, all Israel will see Him, as **Zechariah 12:10** foretells: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until then, His invitation is open: Come to _Yeshua_, the _Messiah_, and live.

> “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him.” (**Revelation 3:20**)
