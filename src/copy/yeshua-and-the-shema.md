# The Shema: From The Jewish-Christian Perspective

**Understanding Its Meaning in Light of Jewish-Christian Doctrine**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

Few prayers are as central to Jewish faith and practice as the Shema. Recited daily by observant Jews for millennia, these words from Deuteronomy 6:4-5 have shaped the identity of Israel:

> "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." (Deut 6:4-5 NIV)

Yet, as Daniel I. Block explores in his study *How Many Is God?*, the Shema invites deeper reflection—not only for Jews but also for Christians seeking to understand its full implications in light of the whole of Scripture.

## The Shema as a Call to Allegiance

Traditionally, many Jewish interpretations emphasize the Shema as a declaration of God's oneness, a defining statement against polytheism. This reading affirms that there is only one God, distinct and indivisible, to whom Israel pledges loyalty. However, Block challenges this assumption by examining the Hebrew text closely:

> *Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad*.

The grammatical structure, Block argues, suggests not merely a philosophical assertion about God’s numerical oneness but rather a demand for exclusive loyalty. A more accurate rendering, Block suggests, could be:

> "Yahweh our God! Yahweh alone!"

In this reading, the emphasis shifts from God’s quantity to God’s exclusivity. The Shema becomes a summons to Israel to pledge their entire allegiance to Yahweh alone, rejecting all competing loyalties to other gods or powers.

## Moses’ Pastoral Concern

Block points out that within the broader context of Deuteronomy, Moses’ concern is pastoral and covenantal. The real threat to Israel is not external enemies but internal idolatry—the temptation to give their hearts to other gods. The Shema, therefore, is not a metaphysical treatise but a covenantal call: love God completely, serve Him alone, and let no rival claim your devotion.

## The Shema in Yeshua's Teaching

Interestingly, the Shema also plays a central role in the teachings of Yeshua. In Mark 12:29-31, when asked about the greatest commandment, Yeshua affirms the Shema:

> "The most important one," answered Yeshua, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'"

Block emphasizes that Yeshua was not debating God's nature here but reaffirming the Shema's call to singular devotion. Yeshua, as a faithful Jew, highlights that loving God entirely is at the heart of the covenant.

## The Shema and Early Christian Faith

The Apostle Paul deepens this connection in 1 Corinthians 8:6:

> "Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Messiah Yeshua, through whom all things came and through whom we live."

Here, Paul echoes the language of the Shema but applies it directly to Messiah Yeshua. Block argues that for Paul, Yeshua is included within the unique identity of Yahweh, thereby affirming the exclusive sovereignty of God while recognizing the Lordship of Messiah.

## A Covenant of Total Commitment

For Jewish believers who follow Yeshua as the Messiah, Block’s interpretation offers a profound understanding: the Shema is not negated but fulfilled in Messiah. The demand for exclusive allegiance to Yahweh remains; what is revealed in the New Testament is that Yeshua Himself embodies Yahweh’s presence among His people.

Thus, the Shema invites every believer to:

* Love God with total devotion (heart, soul, strength);
* Reject any rival gods (whether ancient idols or modern allegiances);
* Recognize in Yeshua the full expression of God’s covenantal love and authority.

## Conclusion: The Shema as a Daily Cry of Allegiance

Block concludes his study with a powerful vision: the true Israelite is one who proclaims daily, "Yahweh our God! Yahweh alone!" For Jewish-Christians, this proclamation affirms the enduring covenant of Israel fulfilled in Yeshua the Messiah. It is not merely recited but lived out in exclusive devotion to the God who has revealed Himself fully in Messiah.

As we recite or meditate upon the Shema, may it continually call us to renewed allegiance, covenantal love, and wholehearted devotion to the one true God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
