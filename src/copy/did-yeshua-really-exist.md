## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is Real

Beloved, if you’re Jewish and wondering about Yeshua of Nazareth, or if you carry questions about His claim to be the Messiah, know this: you’re not alone, and your questions are precious to G-d. With love and boldness, we proclaim that **Yeshua is the promised Messiah**, a historical figure whose life, death, and resurrection fulfill the Tanakh’s prophecies and offer salvation to all. Let us walk together through the evidence, trusting the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to reveal His truth.

## The Historical Evidence: Undeniable and Clear

Yeshua of Nazareth lived in first-century Judea—this is a fact affirmed by secular and religious historians alike. His existence is not a matter of faith alone but of documented history.

**Non-Christian sources confirm Yeshua’s life.** Roman historian Tacitus records that “Christus” was executed under Pontius Pilate during Emperor Tiberius’ reign. Jewish historian Josephus describes Yeshua as a wise teacher who performed remarkable deeds and whose followers persisted after His death, even calling Him “the brother of James, the so-called Messiah.” The Talmud, though critical, acknowledges Yeshua’s execution and reputation as a miracle worker. These sources, written by non-believers, had no reason to invent Him.

**The Gospels are reliable historical records.** Written by Jewish believers, they brim with precise details—names, places, customs—verified by archaeology. Luke’s references to political figures and locations align with modern findings. The New Covenant’s manuscript evidence surpasses any other ancient text, with thousands of copies preserved remarkably intact, as scholars like Bruce Metzger confirm.

If Yeshua were a myth, how could His followers proclaim His resurrection in Jerusalem, where He was crucified, just weeks later? They faced death for their testimony, yet none recanted. People don’t die for a lie they know is false. Their courage points to the truth of Yeshua’s life and resurrection.

## Fulfilled Prophecies: The Messiah Revealed

For Jewish hearts seeking the Messiah, the Tanakh’s prophecies align unmistakably with Yeshua’s life:

- **Born in Bethlehem** _(Micah 5:2)_: Yeshua’s birthplace fulfills this promise.
- **From David’s Line** _(Isaiah 9:7; Jeremiah 23:5)_: His genealogy traces to David.
- **Miraculous Ministry** _(Isaiah 35:5-6)_: He healed the blind, deaf, and lame.
- **Suffering Servant** _(Isaiah 53)_: Pierced for our sins, He bore our punishment, bringing healing.
- **Messiah’s Timing** _(Daniel 9:24-27)_: Daniel foretold Messiah’s death before the Second Temple’s destruction in 70 CE—Yeshua’s crucifixion fits perfectly.

The Dead Sea Scrolls, predating Yeshua, reveal Jewish expectations of a divine, atoning Messiah, aligning with His identity. Only Yeshua fulfills this intricate mosaic of prophecy.

## Addressing Modern Jewish Objections with Love

We cherish the Jewish people and understand concerns about Yeshua’s messianic claims. Let’s address them with Scripture and grace:

- **“The Messiah brings peace, but the world remains broken.”**  
  The Tanakh speaks of a suffering Messiah _(Isaiah 53)_ and a reigning King _(Zechariah 9:9)_. Yeshua fulfills both in two comings: first to atone for sin, then to establish eternal peace. This unites all prophecies in one Messiah.

- **“Why didn’t more Jews accept Him?”**  
  Thousands of Jews, including His disciples, did believe. **Romans 11:25-26** explains Israel’s partial hardening allows Gentiles to enter, but G-d promises all Israel will be saved. **Zechariah 12:10** foretells a day when Israel will recognize “the One they pierced.”

- **“Isn’t a divine Messiah idolatry?”**  
  We affirm one G-d _(Deuteronomy 6:4)_. Yeshua’s incarnation doesn’t diminish G-d’s oneness but reveals His love. **Isaiah 9:6** calls Messiah “Mighty G-d”; the Angel of the L-RD in Genesis speaks as G-d. A divine Messiah is rooted in the Tanakh.

## The Martyrs’ Witness: Lives Given for Truth

Yeshua’s Jewish disciples—Peter, James, John—saw Him die and rise. They faced torture and death rather than deny Him. Their transformed lives, from fear to boldness, testify to the reality of the risen Messiah. No one dies for a fabrication they know is false.

## The Call: Trust Yeshua Today

Dear friend, the evidence is overwhelming: Yeshua lived, died, and rose again, fulfilling the Tanakh’s promises. He is the Messiah, the only way to G-d _(John 14:6)_. With love, we urge you: Repent of sin and trust in Yeshua’s atoning sacrifice. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is L-RD and believe in your heart that G-d raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Isaiah 53**, **Psalm 22**, **Daniel 9**, **Zechariah 12**—and ask G-d to reveal His Messiah. Believing in Yeshua doesn’t mean abandoning your Jewish identity; it means embracing its fulfillment in the One who completes G-d’s covenant.

## Final Word: Yeshua, Israel’s Hope

Yeshua is the Messiah, the fulfillment of G-d’s promises to Israel and the world. **Zechariah 12:10** awaits: “They will look on Me, the One they have pierced.” Until that day, His invitation stands: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in” _(Revelation 3:20)_.

Beloved, Yeshua calls you today. Will you trust Him?
