# Did Yeshua Really Exist?

**A Warm Invitation to Consider the Evidence**

**Humbleberger Ministries**

If you're reading this, perhaps you're Jewish and curious about the historical figure of Jesus, or maybe you carry deep questions about his claims to be the Messiah. First, let me say: you're not alone. Many have asked these questions before you, and many still are. This is a tender and important exploration, one that involves not just historical facts but matters of the heart, faith, and heritage. My goal is to offer you a careful, respectful, and deeply honest look at whether Yeshua truly existed and whether his claims are worth your serious consideration.

### The Historical Evidence: More Solid Than Many Realize

The good news is that historians, both secular and religious, overwhelmingly agree: Jesus of Nazareth was a real person who lived in first-century Judea. This isn't a matter of Christian belief alone; it's a matter of documented history.

**Non-Christian historical sources confirm his existence.** Roman historians such as Tacitus wrote that Christus (Latin for "Christ") was executed under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Emperor Tiberius. The Jewish historian Josephus refers to Jesus as a wise man who performed surprising deeds and whose followers continued even after his death. Josephus even mentions James, calling him "the brother of Jesus who is called the Christ." These are not Christian writings. They come from people with no incentive to invent or support Christian claims.

Even some Jewish rabbinic texts, like certain passages in the Talmud, reference Yeshua's execution and his reputation as a miracle worker, albeit from a critical perspective. These references, while not flattering, clearly indicate that Jesus was a known figure who lived, taught, and was ultimately executed.

**The Gospels are historical documents too.** While written by believers, they are ancient biographies full of specific details—names, places, customs—that have been repeatedly confirmed by archaeology. For example, Luke mentions political figures and places that modern archaeology has verified as accurate. The sheer volume of manuscript evidence for the New Testament far exceeds that of any other ancient text. Scholars like Bruce Metzger and Lee Strobel have documented how reliably these texts have been preserved.

If Jesus were merely a myth, how could a new religious movement claiming his resurrection flourish in Jerusalem, the very city where he was crucified? His earliest followers proclaimed his resurrection publicly just weeks after his death, risking everything to do so. Many paid with their lives. People don't willingly suffer and die for something they know is a lie.

### Fulfilled Prophecies: The Messiah Foretold

For a Jewish audience, the question isn't only whether Jesus lived, but whether he fulfills the Messianic expectations of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). When we look at the Hebrew Scriptures, we find an astonishing alignment between ancient prophecies and the life of Yeshua.

* **Born in Bethlehem** (Micah 5:2) - Yeshua's birth fulfilled this prophecy.
* **From the line of David** (Isaiah 9:7, Jeremiah 23:5) - The Gospels trace his lineage accordingly.
* **Miraculous ministry** (Isaiah 35:5-6) - Yeshua healed the blind, deaf, and lame.
* **Suffering servant** (Isaiah 53) - This profound chapter describes someone who would be "pierced for our transgressions" and who would bear the iniquities of others. Christians see in this a vivid portrait of Jesus' sacrificial death.
* **Timing of Messiah's arrival** (Daniel 9:24-27) - Daniel predicts that Messiah would come and be "cut off" (killed) before the destruction of the Second Temple. Jesus' death fits this timeline perfectly.

Interestingly, even some Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at Qumran, written before Jesus' time, contain expectations of a divine, atoning Messiah. This challenges the assumption that a divine Messiah was a purely Christian invention.

### But What About Jewish Objections?

We understand that many Jewish people have objections to Jesus' messianic claims. Let me address a few common ones with great respect:

* **"The Messiah was supposed to bring peace. Look around; the world is still broken."**
  You're right that full peace has not yet arrived. But many Jewish scholars before Jesus recognized conflicting prophecies: one of a suffering servant, another of a reigning king. Some even posited two Messiahs. Christians believe there is only one Messiah with two comings: first to suffer for sin, then to return and establish everlasting peace. This actually brings together all the strands of the prophetic tapestry.

* **"If Jesus were the Messiah, more Jewish people would have accepted him."**
  Early on, thousands of Jews did believe in him. All his first disciples were Jewish. The apostle Paul explains in Romans 11 that Israel's partial hardening has a divine purpose: so that Gentiles might also be included. But God is not finished with Israel. Zechariah 12:10 prophesies a future day when Israel will recognize "the one they have pierced" and mourn in repentance.

* **"Believing in Jesus seems like idolatry. How can God be a man?"**
  Christians affirm one God (Deuteronomy 6:4). The mystery of the incarnation does not mean God ceased being God, but that He took on human nature for our salvation. The Hebrew Scriptures contain hints of this possibility. For instance, Isaiah 9:6 speaks of a child who will be called "Mighty God." The Angel of the Lord in Genesis often speaks as God Himself. The divine Messiah was not foreign to some streams of Jewish expectation.

### The Early Martyrs: Lives Willingly Given

Consider the testimony of Jesus' own disciples. These Jewish men were not gullible. They lived with Jesus, saw him die, and later claimed they saw him alive again. Nearly all of them suffered persecution and martyrdom rather than deny him. People don't die for what they know to be a fabrication. Their unwavering conviction, even unto death, speaks volumes.

### A Gentle Invitation

If you've read this far, thank you. You are demonstrating the kind of honest seeking that God honors. I write this not as someone trying to win an argument but as someone who believes that Yeshua is indeed the promised Messiah, not just for the Gentiles, but for Israel as well. I believe He is the fulfillment of all the longings of our people, the One who has come and who will come again to complete all that God has promised.

The facts of Jesus' existence are as solid as any in ancient history. The evidence for his Messianic identity is deeply compelling when viewed alongside the Hebrew Scriptures. But ultimately, coming to faith is a matter of the heart, a work of God drawing us to Himself.

I invite you to open the Tanakh and read Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Daniel 9, and Zechariah 12 with fresh eyes. Ask God to show you the truth. You will find that believing in Yeshua does not mean abandoning your Jewish identity. On the contrary, it means embracing its fulfillment.

May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob guide you on this journey.
