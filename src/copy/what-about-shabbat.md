## Dear Friend, Yeshua Is the True Sabbath Rest!

Beloved, the question “Do Jewish-Christians keep Shabbat?” touches the heart of God’s covenant with Israel and the freedom found in Yeshua, the Messiah. Jewish-Christians, often called Messianic Jews, navigate their Jewish heritage and faith in unique ways, especially regarding the Sabbath. With bold confidence and tender love, we proclaim: **Yeshua fulfilled the Torah’s Sabbath, offering true rest through faith while honoring those who observe Shabbat for cultural or spiritual reasons**. Let us explore this question together, resting in the warmth of God’s grace and the certainty of His Word.

## The Tanakh’s Testimony: The Gift of Shabbat

The Hebrew Scriptures establish Shabbat as a sacred gift for Israel’s covenant life:

- **Exodus 20:8-11**: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy… for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth… and rested on the seventh day.” Shabbat commemorates God’s creation rest.
- **Deuteronomy 5:12-15**: “Observe the Sabbath day… you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out.” Shabbat recalls the Exodus.
- **Isaiah 58:13-14**: Honoring the Sabbath brings delight and blessing, setting Israel apart as God’s people.
- **Leviticus 23:3**: “Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest,” emphasizing rest and worship.

Shabbat, a core commandment among the 613 mitzvot, involves refraining from work and engaging in prayer, meals, and community, as a sign of God’s covenant (Hebrew4Christians).

## Yeshua: The Fulfillment of the Sabbath

Dear friend, the New Covenant reveals Yeshua as the Messiah who fulfills the Torah’s Sabbath:

- **Fulfilling the Law**: “I have not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). Yeshua’s life and sacrifice complete the Sabbath’s purpose (GotQuestions.org).
- **True Sabbath Rest**: “There remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God” (Hebrews 4:9-10). Faith in Yeshua offers spiritual rest, fulfilling the Sabbath’s intent.
- **Freedom in Faith**: “Let no one pass judgment on you… with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath” (Colossians 2:16-17). The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15:28-29) did not impose Sabbath observance on believers, suggesting freedom from strict Torah laws.
- **Lord of the Sabbath**: “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:8). Yeshua’s healings on the Sabbath (John 5:8-10) show His authority to define its purpose—rest and restoration.

Many Messianic Jews (175,000 in the U.S., up to 1.7 million globally) observe Shabbat on Friday evening to Saturday, with services, prayers, and meals, to honor their heritage or reach traditional Jews. Others, citing New Testament freedom, may observe it flexibly or worship on Sunday (Jewish Voice; Beth Immanuel).

## The Jewish Perspective: Shabbat as Covenant Core

With love, we acknowledge the Jewish perspective, where Shabbat is a cornerstone of covenant life. Mainstream Judaism—Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform—views Shabbat as a divine commandment, central to Jewish identity, even more significant than Yom Kippur due to its inclusion in the Ten Commandments (Hebrew4Christians). Orthodox Jews strictly observe halachic prohibitions (e.g., no work, no electricity), while Reform Jews may keep it symbolically (My Jewish Learning). Mainstream Judaism rejects Messianic Judaism as non-Jewish due to its belief in Yeshua’s divinity, viewing their Shabbat observance as part of a Christian framework rather than authentic Jewish practice (ABC News).

Messianic Jews who keep Shabbat often do so to maintain Jewish identity, holding services like those of the Southern Baptist Messianic Fellowship, but may not follow all halachic rules due to practical challenges or theological freedom (Wikipedia). The Tanakh’s promise of a new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-33) and a Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) points to Yeshua, whose rest fulfills the Sabbath’s deeper call to holiness.

## What Happens When You Trust Yeshua?

When you trust Yeshua as the Messiah, you enter His rest, with Shabbat as a choice, not an obligation:

- **Forgiveness of Sins**: “The blood of Yeshua His Son cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). Yeshua’s sacrifice fulfills the Torah’s atonement, aligning with the Sabbath’s rest (Leviticus 23:3).
- **Covenant Heir**: “If you belong to Messiah, you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). Your faith connects you to God’s covenant.
- **Spiritual Rest**: The Holy Spirit grants “a Sabbath rest for the people of God” (Hebrews 4:9), fulfilling the Sabbath’s call to holiness through faith (Matthew 11:28-30).
- **Freedom in Choice**: “One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike” (Romans 14:5). You may observe Shabbat to honor your heritage, as many Messianic Jews do, but it’s not required.

Whether you light Shabbat candles or worship on Sunday, your faith in Yeshua produces good works as fruit of a transformed heart (James 2:17).

## The Call: Trust Yeshua as the Sabbath’s Fulfillment

Beloved, many Jewish-Christians keep Shabbat to honor their Jewish roots, but you are not required to, for Yeshua fulfilled the Torah’s Sabbath, offering true rest through faith. With tender urgency, we invite you to trust Him. **Romans 10:9** promises, “If you confess with your mouth that Yeshua is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”

Open the Tanakh—read **Exodus 20**, **Deuteronomy 5**, **Isaiah 58**, **Jeremiah 31**—and ask the God of Israel to reveal His Messiah. Trusting Yeshua fulfills your heritage, whether Jewish or Gentile, aligning you with God’s promises. His love and the Holy Spirit’s guidance will sustain you, whatever your Sabbath practice.

## A Prayer to Trust Yeshua

Dear friend, if you seek the true rest of God’s grace, pray this prayer from your heart:

**Heavenly Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I confess my sins and seek Your redemption. I believe Yeshua is the Messiah, who fulfilled Your Torah through His life, death, and resurrection. I trust in His sacrifice for my salvation. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, guide me in holiness and rest, and strengthen my faith. Thank You for Your love and grace. In Yeshua’s name, Amen.**

## Final Word: Yeshua, The True Sabbath Rest

Yeshua is the promised Messiah who completes the Torah’s Sabbath. **John 1:29** declares, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” He lives, interceding for you (Hebrews 7:25), and one day, as Zechariah 12:10 foretold, Israel will look upon Him and receive grace.

Dear friend, will you trust Yeshua, the risen Messiah, today? **HaMashiach chai! The Messiah lives, and in Him, you find eternal rest, a true heir of God’s promises!**
