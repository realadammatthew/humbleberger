# Yeshua's Gift: A Path to Everlasting Springs

### Are you thirsty for something more?

In a world filled with temporary pleasures and passing promises, many hearts are left dry. The Hebrew Scriptures speak of **living water** — a spiritual source that never runs dry, bringing healing and life.

Could Yeshua be the one who leads us there?

## Living Water in the Hebrew Bible

> _“With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.”_  
> — Isaiah 12:3

The imagery of water flows throughout Scripture — from the rock in the wilderness to the rivers in Ezekiel’s temple vision. Water symbolizes cleansing, renewal, and divine sustenance.

These aren’t just metaphors — they are promises.

## Yeshua’s Invitation to the Thirsty

Yeshua once stood and cried out, _“If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and drink.”_ He promised rivers of living water to those who would believe in Him.

This isn’t religion — it’s restoration.

## A Spring That Never Runs Dry

The world’s answers eventually fade, but Yeshua offers a spring that wells up into eternal life. His gift is free, but priceless. It’s not about effort — it’s about trust.

Could it be that what your soul longs for is found in Him?
