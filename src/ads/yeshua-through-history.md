# Echoes of Yeshua: Tracing Footprints Through History

### Has Yeshua left a trail of truth across the centuries?

Many know Yeshua (Jesus) as the central figure of the New Covenant. But His story didn’t begin in Bethlehem — and it certainly didn’t end in Jerusalem. From ancient prophecy to global impact, the **echoes of Yeshua** reverberate through history.

## A Promise Before the Manger

Centuries before His birth, the Hebrew Scriptures foretold the coming of a Redeemer — a Messiah who would suffer, serve, and save. Isaiah 53, Micah 5, Psalm 22 — each holds footprints pointing to someone still to come.

Could those prophecies be about Yeshua?

## A Life that Changed Time

More books have been written about Yeshua than any other person in history. Calendars shifted because of His life. Nations, movements, and individuals trace their deepest convictions to His teachings.

Why? What makes His story different?

## Jewish Roots, Global Reach

Yeshua was Jewish — born in Judea, raised in Torah, immersed in Jewish tradition. Yet His message reached beyond borders. The promise made to Abraham — “in you all nations will be blessed” — finds its echo in Yeshua’s mission.

## Echoes That Invite You

The question isn’t only “Did He live?” but “What does His life mean for me?”

If Yeshua fulfilled prophecy, lived perfectly, died sacrificially, and rose again… what would that mean for your life, your hope, your eternity?
