# Miracles from a Loving Hand: Yeshua's Compassionate Acts

### Power and compassion — together.

Many seek signs, wonders, and miracles. But what happens when miracles are not just displays of power — but expressions of love?

In the life of Yeshua, **healing and compassion walked hand-in-hand**. His miracles weren’t showy performances. They were **tender responses** to suffering and deep need.

## He Healed the Hurting

He touched the leper.  
He wept for the grieving.  
He restored sight, movement, and dignity.

Yeshua’s miracles reached beyond the physical — they brought hope, restoration, and **a glimpse of the Kingdom**.

## A Fulfillment of Messianic Promise

The Hebrew Scriptures foretold a Messiah who would open blind eyes and heal the brokenhearted. Yeshua did exactly that.

His actions weren’t random. They echoed **Isaiah 35**, **Psalm 146**, and many other promises about the coming Redeemer.

## The Hand That Still Reaches Out

Yeshua’s miracles weren’t limited to ancient days. His heart remains the same. He still moves with compassion, still reaches to heal what’s broken — in body, mind, or soul.

Are you willing to reach back?
