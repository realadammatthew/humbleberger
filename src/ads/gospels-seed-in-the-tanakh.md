# Was the Gospel's Seed Sown in the Tanakh's Soil?

### Could the message of the Gospels begin long before the New Covenant?

Many assume the Gospels — the “good news” — begins with the book of Matthew. But what if its roots are much deeper? What if the message of redemption, sacrifice, and new life was already planted in the very **soil of the Hebrew Scriptures**?

## Hints of Redemption in Genesis

> _“And the L-RD G-d made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.”_  
> —Genesis 3:21

The first covering of shame required a sacrifice. From the very beginning, the concept of atonement — one life in place of another — emerges. The Good News doesn’t interrupt the story. It **fulfills** it.

## The Binding of Isaac: A Father, A Son, A Sacrifice

Abraham is told to offer up Isaac, his beloved son. And just before the sacrifice, G-d provides a ram — a substitute. This isn’t just a test of faith. It’s a **prophetic echo** of a Father who would one day offer His Son for the world.

## The Passover Lamb: Salvation Through Blood

In Exodus, every Israelite household is saved not by strength or merit, but by the **blood of a lamb** placed on their doorposts. The angel of death passes over. It’s a moment of judgment, and mercy — and a powerful foreshadowing of the tree.

## The Prophets Saw It Coming

Isaiah spoke of one who would be “pierced for our transgressions” (Isaiah 53). Jeremiah foretold a new covenant. Ezekiel spoke of new hearts. All pointed to a **Messianic renewal** rooted in the very soil of the Tanakh.

## A Seed That Grew Into the Good News

The Good News isn’t a foreign plant. It’s a seed that was sown in the **rich, prophetic ground** of the Hebrew Bible. In Yeshua, the promises bloom.

Could it be that the Good News was always part of the plan?
