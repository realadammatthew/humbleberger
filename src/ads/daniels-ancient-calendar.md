# Daniel's Ancient Calendar: A Messiah's Promise, Unveiled

### Could Daniel’s prophecy contain a countdown to the Messiah?

For many, prophecy feels mysterious — poetic, symbolic, distant. But Daniel 9 is different. It gives us a specific starting point, a duration, and an outcome: **a Messiah who will be revealed… and then cut off.**

This isn’t just poetry. It’s a calendar.

## Seventy Weeks: Prophetic Precision

> _“Seventy ‘sevens’ are decreed for your people and your holy city…”_  
> — Daniel 9:24

Daniel receives a vision — a heavenly message that a period of 490 prophetic years is marked for the Jewish people. These “seventy sevens” begin with a decree to rebuild Jerusalem.

Many scholars place this decree around 445–444 BCE. Counting forward, 69 “weeks” (or 483 years) take us **right into the first century CE**.

Right into the time of **Yeshua (Jesus)**.

## A Promise Fulfilled — and Misunderstood

The prophecy says the “Anointed One” will come, and then be “cut off.” He will be rejected, and the Temple will later be destroyed. These aren’t just spiritual ideas — they’re historical events.

Yeshua was received by some and rejected by others. He was crucified just days after being hailed as a king in Jerusalem. And 40 years later, the Temple was destroyed.

It happened just as Daniel foresaw.

## Why It Matters

Daniel’s calendar may be ancient, but its implications are immediate. It asks each of us:

- If the timeline fits, what does that say about Yeshua?
- If the prophecy came true, how should we respond?
- If this was promised, could He be the one?

Daniel's calendar isn’t just history — it may be **your invitation**.
