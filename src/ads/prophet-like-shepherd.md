# A Prophet Like a Shepherd: Guiding Us Through Ancient Texts

### Could there be one foretold who would not only speak G-d's word — but gently lead His people?

From Moses to Malachi, the Hebrew Scriptures speak of prophets — chosen vessels through whom G-d revealed His heart. But one prophecy stands out: a promise of **a prophet like Moses**, yet unlike any before.

Who is this prophet, and could he be the shepherd our souls long for?

## The Promise in Deuteronomy

> _“I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers…”_  
> — Deuteronomy 18:18

Moses spoke of one who would come after him — someone with divine authority, intimate with G-d, and able to lead the people with wisdom and compassion.

This wasn’t just another prophet. This one would be **the** prophet.

---

## The Shepherd Imagery

The prophets spoke not only in commands and warnings but also in tender language. Ezekiel spoke of a shepherd who would gather the scattered. Isaiah spoke of one who would carry the lambs close to his heart.

Could this shepherd-prophet be Yeshua?

---

## Yeshua: Prophet, Shepherd, Redeemer

Yeshua (Jesus) claimed what others never dared — that He came not only to speak truth, but to be **the Truth**. His voice calmed storms and called hearts. He saw the lost and had compassion. He taught with authority — yet wept with the broken.

A prophet like Moses. A shepherd like David. A redeemer like no other.
