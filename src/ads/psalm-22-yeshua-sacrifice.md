# Whispers from the Tree: Psalm 22 and Yeshua's Sacrifice

### “My G-d, my G-d, why have You forsaken me?” — a cry echoed from ancient Scripture

Long before crucifixion was known, Psalm 22 painted a picture of a righteous sufferer — mocked, pierced, surrounded by enemies, and stripped of his garments. For many, this hauntingly vivid psalm is more than poetry — it is prophecy.

And at the center of that prophecy stands a tree... and a man named Yeshua.

## A Psalm Ahead of Its Time

Psalm 22 was written by King David around 1,000 BCE. Though it begins in agony, it ends in vindication and praise. Its themes of suffering, rejection, mockery, and hope mirror what would one day happen on a Roman tree outside Jerusalem.

Was David writing about himself — or Someone yet to come?

## Echoes in Yeshua’s Final Moments

Yeshua (Jesus) quoted Psalm 22:1 as He hung on the tree. Many believe He wasn’t just expressing pain — He was pointing back to this prophetic psalm.

Descriptions in Psalm 22 — hands and feet pierced, lots cast for clothing, being surrounded by enemies — seem to align strikingly with the crucifixion narrative.

Could this be more than coincidence?

## Hope Hidden in the Suffering

Psalm 22 doesn’t end in despair. It ends with hope, praise, and global worship of the L-RD. If Yeshua fulfilled this psalm, then His suffering was purposeful — to open the way for redemption.

Through the whispers of this ancient song, we may hear the voice of salvation.
