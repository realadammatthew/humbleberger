# Life Beyond the Veil: The Promise of Resurrection

### Is there hope after death? The Hebrew Scriptures say yes.

The longing for life beyond this one isn’t new. Across centuries and cultures, people have asked: *Is there more after death?* The Hebrew Bible offers a stunning vision — one of **resurrection, renewal, and eternal life**.

And in the center of that promise stands Yeshua, the Messiah who conquered death.

## Glimpses of Resurrection in Jewish Scripture

From Job's cry — *"Yet in my flesh I shall see God"* — to Isaiah’s vision of the earth giving birth to the dead, the Tanakh contains mysterious and hopeful glimpses of life beyond the grave.

Daniel even foretells:  
> _“Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake…”_ — Daniel 12:2

Could this ancient hope speak to our deepest fears?

## Yeshua’s Victory Over Death

Yeshua didn’t just teach resurrection — He walked out of the grave. Witnesses claimed to see Him alive after His crucifixion. His resurrection became the cornerstone of faith for His followers, both Jewish and Gentile.

If Yeshua rose, then death does not have the final word.

## A Personal Promise for You

Resurrection isn’t just about theology — it’s about hope. It means your life matters. It means sorrow isn’t forever. It means love never ends.

Yeshua said, _"I am the resurrection and the life."_ Could His words be your invitation to a life that never fades?
