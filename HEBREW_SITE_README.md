# Hebrew Site Structure

## Overview
This project now includes a dedicated Hebrew version of the website accessible at `/he` routes. The Hebrew site provides proper RTL (right-to-left) layout and native Hebrew content.

## Structure

### Hebrew Pages Created
- `/he` - Hebrew home page
- `/he/blog` - Hebrew blog listing
- `/he/blog/[id]` - Hebrew individual blog posts
- `/he/contact` - Hebrew contact page
- `/he/contact-success` - Hebrew contact success page
- `/he/mission` - Hebrew mission page

### Language Switcher
A language switcher component has been added to both English and Hebrew pages, allowing users to easily switch between languages. The switcher appears in the top-left corner of each page.

## Features

### RTL Support
- All Hebrew pages use `direction: 'rtl'` and `textAlign: 'right'`
- Proper Hebrew text flow and layout
- Maintains consistent styling with the English version

### Navigation
- Hebrew pages link to other Hebrew pages (e.g., `/he/blog`, `/he/contact`)
- Language switcher allows easy navigation between English and Hebrew versions
- Maintains proper referrer tracking for blog posts

### Content
- All text content has been translated to Hebrew
- Maintains the same structure and functionality as English pages
- Uses the same markdown content files for blog posts
