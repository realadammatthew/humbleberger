        <h2>Counting the Cost</h2>
        <div class="article-author">
          By Daniel J. Cross, Humbleberger Ministries
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
          <div class="bible-quote">
            "Whoever wants to be My disciple must deny themselves and take up
            their cross daily and follow Me." — Luke 9:23
          </div>

          <p>
            For many Jewish people, the name "Yeshua" is not merely a name; it's
            a dividing line. It marks the beginning of a path that, for many,
            feels like walking a tightrope between rejection and redemption. And
            for those who are sincerely seeking truth—who are sincerely asking,
            "Could Yeshua really be the Messiah?"—that question doesn't come
            cheap. It comes with a price.
          </p>

          <h3>The Cost of Following Yeshua</h3>
          <p>
            It's easy to speak of "salvation by grace" and "free forgiveness,"
            and yes—salvation is a gift that no man can earn. But accepting that
            gift may cost more than some can bear to imagine. Because for many
            Jewish seekers, following Yeshua means losing everything they've
            known.
          </p>

          <h3>Rejection from Family</h3>
          <p>
            Many Jewish believers in Yeshua have been cut off from family after
            their decision to follow Him. Some are shunned. Some are told they
            are no longer welcome at Shabbat dinner. In certain cases, families
            hold symbolic funerals, declaring the believer to be "dead" to them.
            The grief is real. The loss is not symbolic.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those from Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox backgrounds, the cost can
            be even steeper. Some are excommunicated from their communities,
            kicked out of schools, or denied business relationships. And even
            for secular or Reform Jews, the accusation stings: "You've betrayed
            your people."
          </p>

          <h3>Cultural and Social Loss</h3>
          <p>
            Jewish identity is deeply communal. To accept Yeshua as Messiah is,
            for many, seen as crossing an uncrossable line—a line that separates
            Jew from Gentile, tradition from betrayal, history from heresy. Many
            Jewish believers wrestle with the fear of losing their cultural
            heritage, of being labeled "Christian" in a way that implies they've
            forsaken everything Jewish.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fear isn't hypothetical. It's based in real stories. A Jewish
            woman in Tel Aviv loses her job because she shared her testimony. A
            young man in Brooklyn finds himself suddenly without friends or
            family because he got baptized. A Holocaust survivor in Florida
            confides that her synagogue no longer welcomes her.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are not fictional scenarios—they are the stories we carry with
            us. And they echo the warning of Jesus Himself: "Do not suppose that
            I came to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace,
            but a sword… a man's enemies will be the members of his own
            household." (Matthew 10:34–36)
          </p>

          <h3>Internal Struggle</h3>
          <p>
            Even for those not outwardly persecuted, the inner battle is
            profound. To believe that Yeshua is the Messiah is to question
            years—decades—of teaching. It is to ask if maybe the rabbis were
            wrong. If maybe, somehow, the gospel is true. And that question is
            heavy, because it challenges not only religious identity but also
            emotional and ancestral loyalty. For many Jews, it feels like
            betraying grandparents, ancestors, and martyrs.
          </p>

          <h3>But What If It's True?</h3>
          <p>
            Here is the better question: What if it's true? What if the promised
            Messiah really did come? What if Yeshua really is the fulfillment of
            the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings? What if God did so love
            the world that He gave His only Son?
          </p>
          <p>Then the cost, no matter how heavy, is not too great.</p>

          <h3>The Joy Set Before Us</h3>
          <p>
            "For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross…" (Hebrews 12:2).
          </p>
          <p>
            That same joy—the joy of reunion with the Father, the joy of eternal
            life, the joy of perfect peace—is offered to us who follow Him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeshua was Jewish. His disciples were Jewish. The gospel was first
            preached in Jerusalem. And through Yeshua, the promises made to
            Abraham are fulfilled—not abolished, but fulfilled and expanded,
            reaching Gentile and Jew alike.
          </p>
          <p>In Yeshua, Jewish identity is not lost. It is made whole.</p>

          <h3>The Eternal Reward</h3>
          <p>
            "Truly I tell you," Yeshua said, "no one who has left home or
            brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for Me
            and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this
            present age… and in the age to come, eternal life." (Mark 10:29–30)
          </p>
          <p>There is a cost. But the reward is infinitely greater.</p>
          <p>
            Not merely a better life—but eternal life. Not temporary acceptance
            by men, but everlasting adoption by God. Not fleeting tradition, but
            an unshakable Kingdom. In Messiah, Jewish believers become part of a
            remnant—"chosen by grace" (Romans 11:5)—a foretaste of the final
            ingathering when "all Israel shall be saved" (Romans 11:26).
          </p>

          <h3>Real-World Restoration</h3>
          <p>
            Today, there are Messianic congregations in Tel Aviv, Brooklyn, Los
            Angeles, and even in ultra- Orthodox neighborhoods. Jewish believers
            are worshiping in Hebrew, celebrating the feasts, and walking in the
            light of Yeshua's love. There is a growing remnant. You are not
            alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            More and more Jewish people are coming to see that to follow Yeshua
            is not to reject their heritage, but to fulfill it. That the Messiah
            they've longed for has come—not to erase them, but to save them.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion: Worth Every Step</h3>
          <p>
            To our Jewish brothers and sisters: we know the weight of the
            decision before you. We know how deep the roots run, and how painful
            the pruning can be. But we also know the fruit is worth it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeshua is the Messiah of Israel. He is the Lamb who was slain and
            the Lion of Judah who will return. In Him is not only salvation—but
            the fullness of what it means to be Jewish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't let fear steal the joy God offers. Don't let tradition blind
            you to the One who fulfilled it. Count the cost—then lift your eyes.
          </p>
          <p>The reward is Christ Himself.</p>
